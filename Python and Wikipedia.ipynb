       "[{'Title': 'William Wordsworth',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'William Wordsworth (7 April 1770 – 23 April 1850) was an English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication Lyrical Ballads (1798).\\nWordsworth\\'s magnum opus is generally considered to be The Prelude, a semi-autobiographical poem of his early years that he revised and expanded a number of times. It was posthumously titled and published by his wife in the year of his death, before which it was generally known as \"the poem to Coleridge\".Wordsworth was Britain\\'s poet laureate from 1843 until his death from pleurisy on 23 April 1850.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nThe second of five children born to John Wordsworth and Ann Cookson, William Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in what is now named Wordsworth House in Cockermouth, Cumberland, part of the scenic region in northwestern England known as the Lake District. William\\'s sister, the poet and diarist Dorothy Wordsworth, to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptised together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest, who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who went to sea and died in 1805 when the ship of which he was captain, the Earl of Abergavenny, was wrecked off the south coast of England; and Christopher, the youngest, who entered the Church and rose to be Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.Wordsworth\\'s father was a legal representative of James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and, through his connections, lived in a large mansion in the small town. He was frequently away from home on business, so the young William and his siblings had little involvement with him and remained distant from him until his death in 1783. However, he did encourage William in his reading, and in particular set him to commit large portions of verse to memory, including works by Milton, Shakespeare and Spenser. William was also allowed to use his father\\'s library.\\nWilliam also spent time at his mother\\'s parents\\' house in Penrith, Cumberland, where he was exposed to the moors, but did not get along with his grandparents or his uncle, who also lived there. His hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.Wordsworth was taught to read by his mother and attended, first, a tiny school of low quality in Cockermouth, then a school in Penrith for the children of upper-class families, where he was taught by Ann Birkett, who insisted on instilling in her students traditions that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day and Shrove Tuesday. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the Spectator, but little else. It was at the school in Penrith that he met the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who later became his wife.After the death of Wordsworth\\'s mother, in 1778, his father sent him to Hawkshead Grammar School in Lancashire (now in Cumbria) and sent Dorothy to live with relatives in Yorkshire. She and William did not meet again for another nine years.\\nWordsworth made his debut as a writer in 1787 when he published a sonnet in The European Magazine. That same year he began attending St John\\'s College, Cambridge. He received his BA degree in 1791. He returned to Hawkshead for the first two summers of his time at Cambridge, and often spent later holidays on walking tours, visiting places famous for the beauty of their landscape. In 1790 he went on a walking tour of Europe, during which he toured the Alps extensively, and visited nearby areas of France, Switzerland, and Italy.\\n\\n\\n== Relationship with Annette Vallon ==\\nIn November 1791, Wordsworth visited Revolutionary France and became enchanted with the Republican movement. He fell in love with a French woman, Annette Vallon, who, in 1792, gave birth to their daughter Caroline. Financial problems and Britain\\'s tense relations with France forced him to return to England alone the following year. The circumstances of his return and his subsequent behaviour raised doubts as to his declared wish to marry Annette. However, he supported her and his daughter as best he could in later life. The Reign of Terror left Wordsworth thoroughly disillusioned with the French Revolution and the outbreak of armed hostilities between Britain and France prevented him from seeing Annette and his daughter for some years.\\nWith the Peace of Amiens again allowing travel to France, in 1802 Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited Annette and Caroline in Calais. The purpose of the visit was to prepare Annette for the fact of his forthcoming marriage to Mary Hutchinson. Afterwards he wrote the sonnet \"It is a beauteous evening, calm and free\", recalling a seaside walk with the 9-year-old Caroline, whom he had never seen before that visit. Mary was anxious that Wordsworth should do more for Caroline. Upon Caroline\\'s marriage, in 1816, Wordsworth settled £30 a year on her (equivalent to £1,360 as of the year 2000), payments which continued until 1835, when they were replaced by a capital settlement.\\n\\n\\n== First publication and Lyrical Ballads ==\\n The year 1793 saw the first publication of poems by Wordsworth, in the collections An Evening Walk and Descriptive Sketches. In 1795 he received a legacy of £900 from Raisley Calvert and became able to pursue a career as a poet.\\nIt was also in 1795 that he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. For two years from 1795, William and his sister Dorothy lived at Racedown House in Dorset—a property of the Pinney family—to the west of Pilsdon Pen. They walked in the area for about two hours every day, and the nearby hills consoled Dorothy as she pined for the fells of her native Lakeland. She wrote,\\n\\n\"We have hills which, seen from a distance almost take the character of mountains, some cultivated nearly to their summits, others in their wild state covered with furze and broom. These delight me the most as they remind me of our native wilds.\"\\nIn 1797, the pair moved to Alfoxton House, Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge\\'s home in Nether Stowey. Together Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced Lyrical Ballads (1798), an important work in the English Romantic movement. The volume gave neither Wordsworth\\'s nor Coleridge\\'s name as author. One of Wordsworth\\'s most famous poems, \"Tintern Abbey\", was published in this collection, along with Coleridge\\'s \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". The second edition, published in 1800, had only Wordsworth listed as the author, and included a preface to the poems. It was augmented significantly in the next edition, published in 1802. In this preface, which some scholars consider a central work of Romantic literary theory, Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of verse, one that is based on the ordinary language \"really used by men\" while avoiding the poetic diction of much 18th-century verse. Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility\", and calls his own poems in the book \"experimental\". A fourth and final edition of Lyrical Ballads was published in 1805.\\n\\n\\n== The Borderers ==\\nBetween 1795–1797, Wordsworth wrote his only play, The Borderers, a verse tragedy set during the reign of King Henry III of England, when Englishmen in the North Country came into conflict with Scottish border reivers. He attempted to get the play staged in November 1797, but it was rejected by Thomas Harris, the manager of the Covent Garden Theatre, who proclaimed it \"impossible that the play should succeed in the representation\". The rebuff was not received lightly by Wordsworth and the play was not published until 1842, after substantial revision.\\n\\n\\n== Germany and move to the Lake District ==\\nWordsworth, Dorothy and Coleridge travelled to Germany in the autumn of 1798. While Coleridge was intellectually stimulated by the journey, its main effect on Wordsworth was to produce homesickness. During the harsh winter of 1798–99 Wordsworth lived with Dorothy in Goslar, and, despite extreme stress and loneliness, began work on the autobiographical piece that was later titled The Prelude. He wrote a number of other famous poems in Goslar, including \"The Lucy poems\". In the Autumn of 1799, Wordsworth and his sister returned to England and visited the Hutchinson family at Sockburn. When Coleridge arrived back in England he travelled to the North with their publisher Joseph Cottle to meet Wordsworth and undertake a proposed tour of the Lake District. This was the immediate cause of the brother and sister\\'s settling at Dove Cottage in Grasmere in the Lake District, this time with another poet, Robert Southey, nearby. Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the \"Lake Poets\". Throughout this period many of Wordsworth\\'s poems revolved around themes of death, endurance, separation and grief.\\n\\n\\n== Marriage and children ==\\n\\nIn 1802, Lowther\\'s heir, William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale, paid the £4,000 owed to Wordsworth\\'s father through Lowther\\'s failure to pay his aide. It was this repayment that afforded Wordsworth the financial means to marry. On 4 October, following his visit with Dorothy to France to arrange matters with Annette, Wordsworth married his childhood friend Mary Hutchinson. Dorothy continued to live with the couple and grew close to Mary. The following year Mary gave birth to the first of five children, three of whom predeceased her and William:\\n\\nJohn Wordsworth (18 June 1803 – 1875). Married four times:\\nIsabella Curwen (died 1848) had six children: Jane, Henry, William, John, Charles and Edward.\\nHelen Ross (died 1854). No children.\\nMary Ann Dolan (died after 1858) had one daughter Dora (born 1858).\\nMary Gamble. No children.\\nDora Wordsworth (16 August 1804 – 9 July 1847). Married Edward Quillinan in 1841.\\nThomas Wordsworth (15 June 1806 – 1 December 1812).\\nCatherine Wordsworth (6 September 1808 – 4 June 1812).\\nWilliam \"Willy\" Wordsworth (12 May 1810 – 1883). Married Fanny Graham and had four children: Mary Louisa, William, Reginald, Gordon\\n\\n\\n== Autobiographical work and Poems, in Two Volumes ==\\nWordsworth had for years been making plans to write a long philosophical poem in three parts, which he intended to call The Recluse. In 1798–99 he started an autobiographical poem, which he referred to as the \"poem to Coleridge\" and which he planned would serve as an appendix to a larger work called The Recluse. In 1804 he began expanding this autobiographical work, having decided to make it a prologue rather than an appendix. He completed this work, now generally referred to as the first version of The Prelude, in 1805, but refused to publish such a personal work until he had completed the whole of The Recluse. The death of his brother John, also in 1805, affected him strongly and may have influenced his decisions about these works.\\n\\nWordsworth\\'s philosophical allegiances as articulated in The Prelude and in such shorter works as \"Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey\" have been a source of critical debate. It was long supposed that Wordsworth relied chiefly on Coleridge for philosophical guidance, but more recently scholars have suggested that Wordsworth\\'s ideas may have been formed years before he and Coleridge became friends in the mid-1790s. In particular, while he was in revolutionary Paris in 1792, the 22-year-old Wordsworth made the acquaintance of the mysterious traveler John \"Walking\" Stewart (1747–1822), who was nearing the end of his thirty years of wandering, on foot, from Madras, India, through Persia and Arabia, across Africa and Europe, and up through the fledgling United States. By the time of their association, Stewart had published an ambitious work of original materialist philosophy entitled The Apocalypse of Nature (London, 1791), to which many of Wordsworth\\'s philosophical sentiments may well be indebted.\\nIn 1807 Wordsworth published Poems, in Two Volumes, including \"Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\". Up to this point Wordsworth was known only for Lyrical Ballads, and he hoped that this new collection would cement his reputation. Its reception was lukewarm, however.\\nIn 1810, Wordsworth and Coleridge were estranged over the latter\\'s opium addiction, and in 1812, his son Thomas died at the age of 6, six months after the death of 3-year-old Catherine. The following year he received an appointment as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland, and the stipend of £400 a year made him financially secure, albeit at the cost of political independence. In 1813, he and his family, including Dorothy, moved to Rydal Mount, Ambleside (between Grasmere and Rydal Water), where he spent the rest of his life.\\n\\n\\n== The Prospectus ==\\nIn 1814 Wordsworth published The Excursion as the second part of the three-part work The Recluse, even though he had not completed the first part or the third part, and never did. He did, however, write a poetic Prospectus to The Recluse in which he laid out the structure and intention of the whole work. The Prospectus contains some of Wordsworth\\'s most famous lines on the relation between the human mind and nature:\\n\\nSome modern critics suggest that there was a decline in his work beginning around the mid-1810s, perhaps because most of the concerns that characterised his early poems (loss, death, endurance, separation and abandonment) had been resolved in his writings and his life. By 1820, he was enjoying considerable success accompanying a reversal in the contemporary critical opinion of his earlier works.\\nFollowing the death of his friend the painter William Green in 1823, Wordsworth also mended his relations with Coleridge. The two were fully reconciled by 1828, when they toured the Rhineland together. Dorothy suffered from a severe illness in 1829 that rendered her an invalid for the remainder of her life. Coleridge and Charles Lamb both died in 1834, their loss being a difficult blow to Wordsworth. The following year saw the passing of James Hogg. Despite the death of many contemporaries, the popularity of his poetry ensured a steady stream of young friends and admirers to replace those he lost.\\n\\n\\n== Religious beliefs ==\\nWordsworth\\'s youthful political radicalism, unlike Coleridge\\'s, never led him to rebel against his religious upbringing. He remarked in 1812 that he was willing to shed his blood for the established Church of England, reflected in his Ecclesiastical Sketches of 1822. This religious conservatism also colours The Excursion (1814), a long poem that became extremely popular during the nineteenth century; it features three central characters, the Wanderer; the Solitary, who has experienced the hopes and miseries of the French Revolution; and the Pastor, who dominates the last third of the poem.\\n\\n\\n== Laureateship and other honours ==\\nWordsworth remained a formidable presence in his later years. In 1837, the Scottish poet and playwright Joanna Baillie reflected on her long acquaintance with Wordsworth. \"He looks like a man that one must not speak to unless one has some sensible thing to say. However he does occasionally converse cheerfully & well; and when one knows how benevolent & excellent he is, it disposes one to be very much pleased with him.\"In 1838, Wordsworth received an honorary doctorate in Civil Law from the University of Durham and the following year he was awarded the same honorary degree by the University of Oxford, when John Keble praised him as the \"poet of humanity\", praise greatly appreciated by Wordsworth. (It has been argued that Wordsworth was a great influence on Keble\\'s immensely popular book of devotional poetry, The Christian Year (1827).) In 1842, the government awarded him a Civil List pension of £300 a year.\\nFollowing the death of Robert Southey in 1843 Wordsworth became Poet Laureate. He initially refused the honour, saying that he was too old, but accepted when the Prime Minister, Robert Peel, assured him that \"you shall have nothing required of you\". Wordsworth thus became the only poet laureate to write no official verses. The sudden death of his daughter Dora in 1847 at age 42 was difficult for the aging poet to take and in his depression, he completely gave up writing new material.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\n\\nWilliam Wordsworth died at home at Rydal Mount from an aggravated case of pleurisy on 23 April 1850, and was buried at St Oswald\\'s Church, Grasmere. His widow, Mary, published his lengthy autobiographical \"Poem to Coleridge\" as The Prelude several months after his death. Though it failed to interest people at the time, it has since come to be widely recognised as his masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nWordsworth has appeared as a character in works of fiction, including:\\n\\nWilliam Kinsolving – Mister Christian. 1996\\nJasper Fforde – The Eyre Affair. 2001\\nVal McDermid – The Grave Tattoo. 2006\\nSue Limb –  The Wordsmiths at Gorsemere. 2008Isaac Asimov\\'s 1966 novelization of the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage sees Dr. Peter Duval quoting Wordsworth\\'s The Prelude as the miniaturized submarine sails through the cerebral fluid surrounding a human brain, comparing it to the \"strange seas of thought\".\\n\\n\\n== Major works ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of poets\\nLake Poets\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nJuliet Barker.

       " {'Title': 'Samuel Taylor Coleridge',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'Samuel Taylor Coleridge  (; 21 October 1772 – 25 July 1834) was an English poet, literary critic, philosopher and theologian who, with his friend William Wordsworth, was a founder of the Romantic Movement in England and a member of the Lake Poets.  He also shared volumes and collaborated with Charles Lamb, Robert Southey, and Charles Lloyd. He wrote the poems The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, as well as the major prose work Biographia Literaria. His critical work, especially on William Shakespeare, was highly influential, and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy to English-speaking culture. Coleridge coined many familiar words and phrases, including suspension of disbelief. He had a major influence on Ralph Waldo Emerson and American transcendentalism.\\nThroughout his adult life Coleridge had crippling bouts of anxiety and depression; it has been speculated that he had bipolar disorder, which had not been defined during his lifetime. He was physically unhealthy, which may have stemmed from a bout of rheumatic fever and other childhood illnesses. He was treated for these conditions with laudanum, which fostered a lifelong opium addiction.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\n\\nColeridge was born on 21 October 1772 in the Town of Ottery St Mary in Devon, England. Samuel\\'s father was the Reverend John Coleridge (1718–1781), the well-respected vicar of St Mary\\'s Church, Ottery St Mary and was headmaster of the King\\'s School, a free grammar school established by King Henry VIII (1509–1547) in the town. He had previously been master of Hugh Squier\\'s School in South Molton, Devon, and lecturer of nearby Molland.\\nJohn Coleridge had three children by his first wife. Samuel was the youngest of ten by the Reverend Mr. Coleridge\\'s second wife, Anne Bowden (1726–1809), probably the daughter of John Bowden, Mayor of South Molton, Devon, in 1726. Coleridge suggests that he \"took no pleasure in boyish sports\" but instead read \"incessantly\" and played by himself. After John Coleridge died in 1781, 8-year-old Samuel was sent to Christ\\'s Hospital, a charity school which was founded in the 16th century in Greyfriars, London, where he remained throughout his childhood, studying and writing poetry. At that school Coleridge became friends with Charles Lamb, a schoolmate, and studied the works of Virgil and William Lisle Bowles.\\nIn one of a series of autobiographical letters written to Thomas Poole, Coleridge wrote: \"At six years old I remember to have read Belisarius, Robinson Crusoe, and Philip Quarll – and then I found the Arabian Nights\\' Entertainments – one tale of which (the tale of a man who was compelled to seek for a pure virgin) made so deep an impression on me (I had read it in the evening while my mother was mending stockings) that I was haunted by spectres whenever I was in the dark – and I distinctly remember the anxious and fearful eagerness with which I used to watch the window in which the books lay – and whenever the sun lay upon them, I would seize it, carry it by the wall, and bask, and read.\"\\nColeridge seems to have appreciated his teacher, as he wrote in recollections of his school days in Biographia Literaria: \\n\\nI enjoyed the inestimable advantage of a very sensible, though at the same time, a very severe master [...] At the same time that we were studying the Greek Tragic Poets, he made us read Shakespeare and Milton as lessons: and they were the lessons too, which required most time and trouble to bring up, so as to escape his censure. I learnt from him, that Poetry, even that of the loftiest, and, seemingly, that of the wildest odes, had a logic of its own, as severe as that of science; and more difficult, because more subtle, more complex, and dependent on more, and more fugitive causes. [...] In our own English compositions (at least for the last three years of our school education) he showed no mercy to phrase, metaphor, or image, unsupported by a sound sense, or where the same sense might have been conveyed with equal force and dignity in plainer words... In fancy I can almost hear him now, exclaiming Harp? Harp? Lyre? Pen and ink, boy, you mean! Muse, boy, Muse? your Nurse\\'s daughter, you mean! Pierian spring? Oh aye! the cloister-pump, I suppose! [...] Be this as it may, there was one custom of our master\\'s, which I cannot pass over in silence, because I think it ... worthy of imitation. He would often permit our theme exercises, ... to accumulate, till each lad had four or five to be looked over. Then placing the whole number abreast on his desk, he would ask the writer, why this or that sentence might not have found as appropriate a place under this or that other thesis: and if no satisfying answer could be returned, and two faults of the same kind were found in one exercise, the irrevocable verdict followed, the exercise was torn up, and another on the same subject to be produced, in addition to the tasks of the day.  \\nHe later wrote of his loneliness at school in the poem Frost at Midnight:\\n\"With unclosed lids, already had I dreamt/Of my sweet birthplace.\"\\nFrom 1791 until 1794, Coleridge attended Jesus College, Cambridge. In 1792, he won the Browne Gold Medal for an ode that he wrote on the slave trade. In December 1793, he left the college and enlisted in the 15th (The King\\'s) Light Dragoons using the false name \"Silas Tomkyn Comberbache\", perhaps because of debt or because the girl that he loved, Mary Evans, had rejected him. His brothers arranged for his discharge a few months later under the reason of \"insanity\" and he was readmitted to Jesus College, though he would never receive a degree from the university.\\n\\n\\n== Pantisocracy and marriage ==\\n\\n\\n=== Cambridge and Somerset ===\\nAt Jesus College, Coleridge was introduced to political and theological ideas then considered radical, including those of the poet Robert Southey with whom he collaborated on the play The Fall of Robespierre. Coleridge joined Southey in a plan, later abandoned, to found a utopian commune-like society, called Pantisocracy, in the wilderness of Pennsylvania. In 1795, the two friends married sisters Sara and Edith Fricker, in St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, but Coleridge\\'s marriage with Sara proved unhappy. He grew to detest his wife, whom he married mainly because of social constraints. Following the birth of their fourth child, he eventually separated from her.\\nA third sister, Mary, had already married a third poet Robert Lovell and both became partners in Pantisocracy. Lovell also introduced Coleridge and Southey to their future patron Joseph Cottle but died of a fever in April 1796. Coleridge was with him at his death.\\nIn 1796 he released his first volume of poems entitled Poems on various subjects, which also included four poems by Charles Lamb as well as a collaboration with Robert Southey and a work suggested by his and Lamb\\'s schoolfriend Robert Favell. Among the poems were Religious Musings, Monody on the Death of Chatterton and an early version of The Eolian Harp entitled Effusion 35. A second edition was printed in 1797, this time including an appendix of works by Lamb and Charles Lloyd, a young poet to whom Coleridge had become a private tutor.\\nIn 1796 he also privately printed Sonnets from Various Authors, including sonnets by Lamb, Lloyd, Southey and himself as well as older poets such as William Lisle Bowles.\\nColeridge made plans to establish a journal, The Watchman, to be printed every eight days to avoid a weekly newspaper tax. The first issue of the short-lived journal was published in March 1796. It had ceased publication by May of that year.The years 1797 and 1798, during which he lived in what is now known as Coleridge Cottage, in Nether Stowey, Somerset, were among the most fruitful of Coleridge\\'s life. In 1795, Coleridge met poet William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy. (Wordsworth, having visited him and being enchanted by the surroundings, rented Alfoxton Park, a little over three miles [5 km] away.) Besides The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Coleridge composed the symbolic poem Kubla Khan, written—Coleridge himself claimed—as a result of an opium dream, in \"a kind of a reverie\"; and the first part of the narrative poem Christabel. The writing of Kubla Khan, written about the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan and his legendary palace at Xanadu, was said to have been interrupted by the arrival of a \"Person from Porlock\" – an event that has been embellished upon in such varied contexts as science fiction and Nabokov\\'s Lolita. During this period, he also produced his much-praised \"conversation poems\" This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison, Frost at Midnight, and The Nightingale.\\nIn 1798, Coleridge and Wordsworth published a joint volume of poetry, Lyrical Ballads, which proved to be the starting point for the English romantic age. Wordsworth may have contributed more poems, but the real star of the collection was Coleridge\\'s first version of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. It was the longest work and drew more praise and attention than anything else in the volume. In the spring Coleridge temporarily took over for Rev. Joshua Toulmin at Taunton\\'s Mary Street Unitarian Chapel while Rev. Toulmin grieved over the drowning death of his daughter Jane. Poetically commenting on Toulmin\\'s strength, Coleridge wrote in a 1798 letter to John Prior Estlin, \"I walked into Taunton (eleven miles) and back again, and performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin.  I suppose you must have heard that his daughter, (Jane, on 15 April 1798) in a melancholy derangement, suffered herself to be swallowed up by the tide on the sea-coast between Sidmouth and Bere  [sic] (Beer).  These events cut cruelly into the hearts of old men: but the good Dr. Toulmin bears it like the true practical Christian, – there is indeed a tear in his eye, but that eye is lifted up to the Heavenly Father.\"\\n\\n\\n=== The West Midlands and the North ===\\nColeridge also worked briefly in Shropshire, where he came in December 1797 as locum to its local Unitarian minister, Dr Rowe, in their church in the High Street at Shrewsbury.  He is said to have read his Rime of the Ancient Mariner at a literary evening in Mardol.  He was then contemplating a career in the ministry, and gave a probationary sermon in High Street church on Sunday, 14 January 1798. William Hazlitt, a Unitarian minister\\'s son, was in the congregation, having walked from Wem to hear him.  Coleridge later visited Hazlitt and his father at Wem but within a day or two of preaching he received a letter from Josiah Wedgwood II, who had offered to help him out of financial difficulties with an annuity of £150 (approximately £13,000 in today\\'s money) per year on condition he give up his ministerial career.  Coleridge accepted this, to the disappointment of Hazlitt who hoped to have him as a neighbour in Shropshire.From 16 September 1798, Coleridge and the Wordsworths left for a stay in Germany; Coleridge soon went his own way and spent much of his time in university towns. In February 1799 he enrolled at the University of Göttingen, where he attended lectures by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and Johann Gottfried Eichhorn. During this period, he became interested in German philosophy, especially the transcendental idealism and critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and in the literary criticism of the 18th-century dramatist Gotthold Lessing. Coleridge studied German and, after his return to England, translated the dramatic trilogy Wallenstein by the German Classical poet Friedrich Schiller into English. He continued to pioneer these ideas through his own critical writings for the rest of his life (sometimes without attribution), although they were unfamiliar and difficult for a culture dominated by empiricism.\\nIn 1799, Coleridge and the Wordsworths stayed at Thomas Hutchinson\\'s farm on the River Tees at Sockburn, near Darlington.\\n\\nIt was at Sockburn that Coleridge wrote his ballad-poem Love, addressed to Sara Hutchinson. The knight mentioned is the mailed figure on the Conyers tomb in ruined Sockburn church. The figure has a wyvern at his feet, a reference to the Sockburn Worm slain by Sir John Conyers (and a possible source for Lewis Carroll\\'s Jabberwocky). The worm was supposedly buried under the rock in the nearby pasture; this was the \\'greystone\\' of Coleridge\\'s first draft, later transformed into a \\'mount\\'. The poem was a direct inspiration for John Keats\\' famous poem La Belle Dame Sans Merci.Coleridge\\'s early intellectual debts, besides German idealists like Kant and critics like Lessing, were first to William Godwin\\'s Political Justice, especially during his Pantisocratic period, and to David Hartley\\'s Observations on Man, which is the source of the psychology which is found in Frost at Midnight. Hartley argued that one becomes aware of sensory events as impressions, and that \"ideas\" are derived by noticing similarities and differences between impressions and then by naming them. Connections resulting from the coincidence of impressions create linkages, so that the occurrence of one impression triggers those links and calls up the memory of those ideas with which it is associated (See Dorothy Emmet, \"Coleridge and Philosophy\").\\nColeridge was critical of the literary taste of his contemporaries, and a literary conservative insofar as he was afraid that the lack of taste in the ever growing masses of literate people would mean a continued desecration of literature itself.\\nIn 1800, he returned to England and shortly thereafter settled with his family and friends in Greta Hall at Keswick in the Lake District of Cumberland to be near Grasmere, where Wordsworth had moved. He was a houseguest of the Wordsworths\\' for eighteen months, but was a difficult houseguest, as his dependency on laudanum grew and his frequent nightmares would wake the children. He was also a fussy eater, to Dorothy Wordsworth\\'s frustration, who had to cook. For example, not content with salt, Coleridge sprinkled cayenne pepper on his eggs, which he ate from a teacup. His marital problems, nightmares, illnesses, increased opium dependency, tensions with Wordsworth, and a lack of confidence in his poetic powers fuelled the composition of Dejection: An Ode and an intensification of his philosophical studies.In 1802, Coleridge took a nine-day walking holiday in the fells of the Lake District. Coleridge is credited with the first recorded descent of Scafell to Mickledore via Broad Stand, although this was more due to his getting lost than a keenness for mountaineering.\\n\\n\\n== Later life and increasing drug use ==\\n\\n\\n=== Travel and The Friend ===\\nIn 1804, he travelled to Sicily and Malta, working for a time as Acting Public Secretary of Malta under the Civil Commissioner, Alexander Ball, a task he performed quite successfully. He lived in San Anton Palace in the village of Attard.  He gave this up and returned to England in 1806. Dorothy Wordsworth was shocked at his condition upon his return. From 1807 to 1808, Coleridge returned to Malta and then travelled in Sicily and Italy, in the hope that leaving Britain\\'s damp climate would improve his health and thus enable him to reduce his consumption of opium. Thomas De Quincey alleges in his Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets that it was during this period that Coleridge became a full-blown opium addict, using the drug as a substitute for the lost vigour and creativity of his youth.  It has been suggested that this reflects De Quincey\\'s own experiences more than Coleridge\\'s.His opium addiction (he was using as much as two quarts of laudanum a week) now began to take over his life: he separated from his wife Sara in 1808, quarrelled with Wordsworth in 1810, lost part of his annuity in 1811, and put himself under the care of Dr. Daniel in 1814. His addiction caused severe constipation, which required regular and humiliating enemas.In 1809, Coleridge made his second attempt to become a newspaper publisher with the publication of the journal entitled The Friend. It was a weekly publication that, in Coleridge\\'s typically ambitious style, was written, edited, and published almost entirely single-handedly. Given that Coleridge tended to be highly disorganised and had no head for business, the publication was probably doomed from the start. Coleridge financed the journal by selling over five hundred subscriptions, over two dozen of which were sold to members of Parliament, but in late 1809, publication was crippled by a financial crisis and Coleridge was obliged to approach \"Conversation Sharp\", Tom Poole and one or two other wealthy friends for an emergency loan to continue. The Friend was an eclectic publication that drew upon every corner of Coleridge\\'s remarkably diverse knowledge of law, philosophy, morals, politics, history, and literary criticism. Although it was often turgid, rambling, and inaccessible to most readers, it ran for 25 issues and was republished in book form a number of times. Years after its initial publication, The Friend became a highly influential work and its effect was felt on writers and philosophers from John Stuart Mill to Ralph Waldo Emerson.\\n\\n\\n=== London: final years and death ===\\n\\nBetween 1810 and 1820, Coleridge gave a series of lectures in London and Bristol – those on Shakespeare renewed interest in the playwright as a model for contemporary writers. Much of Coleridge\\'s reputation as a literary critic is founded on the lectures that he undertook in the winter of 1810–11, which were sponsored by the Philosophical Institution and given at Scot\\'s Corporation Hall off Fetter Lane, Fleet Street. These lectures were heralded in the prospectus as \"A Course of Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton, in Illustration of the Principles of Poetry.\" Coleridge\\'s ill-health, opium-addiction problems, and somewhat unstable personality meant that all his lectures were plagued with problems of delays and a general irregularity of quality from one lecture to the next. As a result of these factors, Coleridge often failed to prepare anything but the loosest set of notes for his lectures and regularly entered into extremely long digressions which his audiences found difficult to follow. However, it was the lecture on Hamlet given on 2 January 1812 that was considered the best and has influenced Hamlet studies ever since. Before Coleridge, Hamlet was often denigrated and belittled by critics from Voltaire to Dr. Johnson. Coleridge rescued the play\\'s reputation, and his thoughts on it are often still published as supplements to the text.\\nIn 1812 he allowed Robert Southey to make use of extracts from his vast number of private notebooks in their collaboration Omniana; Or, Horae Otiosiores.\\nIn August 1814, Coleridge was approached by Lord Byron\\'s publisher, John Murray, about the possibility of translating Goethe\\'s classic Faust (1808). Coleridge was regarded by many as the greatest living writer on the demonic and he accepted the commission, only to abandon work on it after six weeks. Until recently, scholars were in agreement that Coleridge never returned to the project, despite Goethe\\'s own belief in the 1820s that he had in fact completed a long translation of the work. In September 2007, Oxford University Press sparked a heated scholarly controversy by publishing an English translation of Goethe\\'s work that purported to be Coleridge\\'s long-lost masterpiece (the text in question first appeared anonymously in 1821).Between 1814 and 1816, Coleridge lived in Calne, Wiltshire and seemed able to focus on his work and manage his addiction, drafting Biographia Literaria. He rented rooms from a local surgeon, Mr Page, on Church Street, just opposite the entrance to the churchyard. A blue plaque marks the property today.In April 1816, Coleridge, with his addiction worsening, his spirits depressed, and his family alienated, took residence in the Highgate homes, then just north of London, of the physician James Gillman, first at South Grove and later at the nearby 3 The Grove. It is unclear whether his growing use of opium (and the brandy in which it was dissolved) was a symptom or a cause of his growing depression. Gillman was partially successful in controlling the poet\\'s addiction. Coleridge remained in Highgate for the rest of his life, and the house became a place of literary pilgrimage for writers including Carlyle and Emerson.\\nIn Gillman\\'s home, Coleridge finished his major prose work, the Biographia Literaria (mostly drafted in 1815, and finished in 1817), a volume composed of 23 chapters of autobiographical notes and dissertations on various subjects, including some incisive literary theory and criticism. He composed a considerable amount of poetry, of variable quality. He published other writings while he was living at the Gillman homes, notably the Lay Sermons of 1816 and 1817, Sibylline Leaves (1817), Hush (1820), Aids to Reflection (1825), and On the Constitution of the Church and State (1830). He also produced essays published shortly after his death, such as Essay on Faith (1838) and Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit (1840). A number of his followers were central to the Oxford Movement, and his religious writings profoundly shaped Anglicanism in the mid-nineteenth century.Coleridge also worked extensively on the various manuscripts which form his \"Opus Maximum\", a work which was in part intended as a post-Kantian work of philosophical synthesis.  The work was never published in his lifetime, and has frequently been seen as evidence for his tendency to conceive grand projects which he then had difficulty in carrying through to completion. But while he frequently berated himself for his \"indolence\", the long list of his published works calls this myth into question. Critics are divided on whether the \"Opus Maximum\", first published in 2002, successfully resolved the philosophical issues he had been exploring for most of his adult life.\\nColeridge died in Highgate, London on 25 July 1834 as a result of heart failure compounded by an unknown lung disorder, possibly linked to his use of opium. Coleridge had spent 18 years under the roof of the Gillman family, who built an addition onto their home to accommodate the poet.Faith may be defined as fidelity to our own being, so far as such being is not and cannot become an object of the senses; and hence, by clear inference or implication to being generally, as far as the same is not the object of the senses; and again to whatever is affirmed or understood as the condition, or concomitant, or consequence of the same. This will be best explained by an instance or example. That I am conscious of something within me peremptorily commanding me to do unto others as I would they should do unto me; in other words a categorical (that is, primary and unconditional) imperative; that the maxim (regula maxima, or supreme rule) of my actions, both inward and outward, should be such as I could, without any contradiction arising therefrom, will to be the law of all moral and rational beings. Essay on Faith\\nCarlyle described him at Highgate: \"Coleridge sat on the brow of Highgate Hill, in those years, looking down on London and its smoke-tumult, like a sage escaped from the inanity of life\\'s battle ... The practical intellects of the world did not much heed him, or carelessly reckoned him a metaphysical dreamer: but to the rising spirits of the young generation he had this dusky sublime character; and sat there as a kind of Magus, girt in mystery and enigma; his Dodona oak-grove (Mr. Gilman\\'s house at Highgate) whispering strange things, uncertain whether oracles or jargon.\"\\n\\n\\n== Remains ==\\nColeridge is buried in the aisle of St. Michael\\'s Parish Church in Highgate, London. He was originally buried at Old Highgate Chapel but was re-interred in St. Michael\\'s in 1961. Coleridge could see the red door of the then new church from his last residence across the green, where he lived with a doctor he had hoped might cure him (in a house owned today by Kate Moss). When it was discovered Coleridge\\'s vault had become derelict, the coffins – Coleridge\\'s and those of his wife, daughter, son-in-law, and grandson – were moved to St. Michael\\'s after an international fundraising appeal.Drew Clode, a member of St. Michael\\'s stewardship committee states, \"they put the coffins in a convenient space which was dry and secure, and quite suitable, bricked them up and forgot about them\". A recent excavation revealed the coffins were not in the location most believed, the far corner of the crypt, but actually below a memorial slab in the nave inscribed with: “Beneath this stone lies the body of Samuel Taylor Coleridge”.St. Michael\\'s plans to restore the crypt and allow public access. Says vicar Kunle Ayodeji of the plans: “. . we hope that the whole crypt can be cleared as a space for meetings and other uses, which would also allow access to Coleridge’s cellar.”\\n\\n\\n== Poetry ==\\nColeridge is one of the most important figures in English poetry. His poems directly and deeply influenced all the major poets of the age. He was known by his contemporaries as a meticulous craftsman who was more rigorous in his careful reworking of his poems than any other poet, and Southey and Wordsworth were dependent on his professional advice. His influence on Wordsworth is particularly important because many critics have credited Coleridge with the very idea of \"Conversational Poetry\". The idea of utilising common, everyday language to express profound poetic images and ideas for which Wordsworth became so famous may have originated almost entirely in Coleridge’s mind. It is difficult to imagine Wordsworth’s great poems, The Excursion or The Prelude, ever having been written without the direct influence of Coleridge’s originality.\\nAs important as Coleridge was to poetry as a poet, he was equally important to poetry as a critic. His philosophy of poetry, which he developed over many years, has been deeply influential in the field of literary criticism. This influence can be seen in such critics as A. O. Lovejoy and I. A. Richards.\\n\\n\\n=== The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Christabel, and Kubla Khan ===\\n\\nColeridge is arguably best known for his longer poems, particuarly The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Christabel. Even those who have never read the Rime have come under its influence: its words have given the English language the metaphor of an albatross around one\\'s neck, the quotation of \"water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink\" (almost always rendered as \"but not a drop to drink\"), and the phrase \"a sadder and a wiser man\" (usually rendered as \"a sadder but wiser man\"). The phrase \"All creatures great and small\" may have been inspired by The Rime: \"He prayeth best, who loveth best;/ All things both great and small;/ For the dear God who loveth us;/ He made and loveth all.\" Christabel is known for its musical rhythm, language, and its Gothic tale.\\nKubla Khan, or, A Vision in a Dream, A Fragment, although shorter, is also widely known. Both Kubla Khan and Christabel have an additional \"Romantic\" aura because they were never finished. Stopford Brooke characterised both poems as having no rival due to their \"exquisite metrical movement\" and \"imaginative phrasing.\"\\n\\n\\n=== The Conversation poems ===\\n\\nThe eight of Coleridge\\'s poems listed above are now often discussed as a group entitled \"Conversation poems\". The term itself was coined in 1928 by George McLean Harper, who borrowed the subtitle of The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem (1798) to describe the seven other poems as well. The poems are considered by many critics to be among Coleridge\\'s finest verses; thus Harold Bloom has written, \"With Dejection, The Ancient Mariner, and Kubla Khan, Frost at Midnight shows Coleridge at his most impressive.\" They are also among his most influential poems, as discussed further below.\\nHarper himself considered that the eight poems represented a form of blank verse that is \"...more fluent and easy than Milton\\'s, or any that had been written since Milton\". In 2006 Robert Koelzer wrote about another aspect of this apparent \"easiness\", noting that Conversation poems such as \"... Coleridge\\'s The Eolian Harp and The Nightingale maintain a middle register of speech, employing an idiomatic language that is capable of being construed as un-symbolic and un-musical: language that lets itself be taken as \\'merely talk\\' rather than rapturous \\'song\\'.\"\\n\\nThe last ten lines of Frost at Midnight were chosen by Harper as the \"best example of the peculiar kind of blank verse Coleridge had evolved, as natural-seeming as prose, but as exquisitely artistic as the most complicated sonnet.\" The speaker of the poem is addressing his infant son, asleep by his side:\\n\\nIn 1965, M. H. Abrams wrote a broad description that applies to the Conversation poems: \"The speaker begins with a description of the landscape; an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied by integral process of memory, thought, anticipation, and feeling which remains closely intervolved with the outer scene. In the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight, faces up to a tragic loss, comes to a moral decision, or resolves an emotional problem. Often the poem rounds itself to end where it began, at the outer scene, but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which is the result of the intervening meditation.\" In fact, Abrams was describing both the Conversation poems and later poems influenced by them. Abrams\\' essay has been called a \"touchstone of literary criticism\". As Paul Magnuson described it in 2002, \"Abrams credited Coleridge with originating what Abrams called the \\'greater Romantic lyric\\', a genre that began with Coleridge\\'s \\'Conversation\\' poems, and included Wordsworth\\'s Tintern Abbey, Shelley\\'s Stanzas Written in Dejection and Keats\\'s Ode to a Nightingale, and was a major influence on more modern lyrics by Matthew Arnold, Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and W. H. Auden.\"\\n\\n\\n== Literary criticism ==\\n\\n\\n=== Biographia Literaria ===\\nIn addition to his poetry, Coleridge also wrote influential pieces of literary criticism including Biographia Literaria, a collection of his thoughts and opinions on literature which he published in 1817. The work delivered both biographical explanations of the author\\'s life as well as his impressions on literature. The collection also contained an analysis of a broad range of philosophical principles of literature ranging from Aristotle to Immanuel Kant and Schelling and applied them to the poetry of peers such as William Wordsworth. Coleridge\\'s explanation of metaphysical principles were popular topics of discourse in academic communities throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and T.S. Eliot stated that he believed that Coleridge was \"perhaps the greatest of English critics, and in a sense the last.\" Eliot suggests that Coleridge displayed \"natural abilities\" far greater than his contemporaries, dissecting literature and applying philosophical principles of metaphysics in a way that brought the subject of his criticisms away from the text and into a world of logical analysis that mixed logical analysis and emotion. However, Eliot also criticises Coleridge for allowing his emotion to play a role in the metaphysical process, believing that critics should not have emotions that are not provoked by the work being studied. Hugh Kenner in Historical Fictions, discusses Norman Fruman\\'s Coleridge, the Damaged Archangel and suggests that the term \"criticism\" is too often applied to Biographia Literaria, which both he and Fruman describe as having failed to explain or help the reader understand works of art. To Kenner, Coleridge\\'s attempt to discuss complex philosophical concepts without describing the rational process behind them displays a lack of critical thinking that makes the volume more of a biography than a work of criticism.In Biographia Literaria and his poetry, symbols are not merely \"objective correlatives\" to Coleridge, but instruments for making the universe and personal experience intelligible and spiritually covalent. To Coleridge, the \"cinque spotted spider,\" making its way upstream \"by fits and starts,\" [Biographia Literaria] is not merely a comment on the intermittent nature of creativity, imagination, or spiritual progress, but the journey and destination of his life. The spider\\'s five legs represent the central problem that Coleridge lived to resolve, the conflict between Aristotelian logic and Christian philosophy. Two legs of the spider represent the \"me-not me\" of thesis and antithesis, the idea that a thing cannot be itself and its opposite simultaneously, the basis of the clockwork Newtonian world view that Coleridge rejected. The remaining three legs—exothesis, mesothesis and synthesis or the Holy trinity—represent the idea that things can diverge without being contradictory. Taken together, the five legs—with synthesis in the center, form the Holy Cross of Ramist logic. The cinque-spotted spider is Coleridge\\'s emblem of holism, the quest and substance of Coleridge\\'s thought and spiritual life.\\n\\n\\n=== Coleridge and the influence of the Gothic ===\\n\\nColeridge wrote reviews of Ann Radcliffe\\'s books and The Mad Monk, among others. He comments in his reviews: \"Situations of torment, and images of naked horror, are easily conceived; and a writer in whose works they abound, deserves our gratitude almost equally with him who should drag us by way of sport through a military hospital, or force us to sit at the dissecting-table of a natural philosopher. To trace the nice boundaries, beyond which terror and sympathy are deserted by the pleasurable emotions, – to reach those limits, yet never to pass them, hic labor, hic opus est.\" and \"The horrible and the preternatural have usually seized on the popular taste, at the rise and decline of literature.  Most powerful stimulants, they can never be required except by the torpor of an unawakened, or the languor of an exhausted, appetite...  We trust, however, that satiety will banish what good sense should have prevented; and that, wearied with fiends, incomprehensible characters, with shrieks, murders, and subterraneous dungeons, the public will learn, by the multitude of the manufacturers, with how little expense of thought or imagination this species of composition is manufactured.\"\\nHowever, Coleridge used these elements in poems such as The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798), Christabel and Kubla Khan (published in 1816, but known in manuscript form before then) and certainly influenced other poets and writers of the time. Poems like these both drew inspiration from and helped to inflame the craze for Gothic romance. Coleridge also made considerable use of Gothic elements in his commercially successful play Remorse.Mary Shelley, who knew Coleridge well, mentions The Rime of the Ancient Mariner twice directly in Frankenstein, and some of the descriptions in the novel echo it indirectly. Although William Godwin, her father, disagreed with Coleridge on some important issues, he respected his opinions and Coleridge often visited the Godwins. Mary Shelley later recalled hiding behind the sofa and hearing his voice chanting The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\nC. S. Lewis also makes mention of his name in The Screwtape Letters (as a poor example of prayer, in which the devils should encourage).\\n\\n\\n== Religious beliefs ==\\nAlthough his father was an Anglican vicar, Coleridge worked as a Unitarian preacher between 1796 and 1797. He eventually returned to the Church of England in 1814. His most noteworthy writings on religion are Lay Sermons (1817), Aids to Reflection (1825) and The Constitution of Church and State (1830).\\n\\n\\n=== Theological legacy ===\\nDespite being mostly remembered today for his poetry and literary criticism, Coleridge was also (perhaps in his own eyes primarily) a theologian. His writings include discussions of the status of scripture, the doctrines of the Fall, justification and sanctification, and the personality and infinity of God. A key figure in the Anglican theology of his day, his writings are still regularly referred to by contemporary Anglican theologians. F. D. Maurice, F. J. A. Hort, F. W. Robertson, B. F. Westcott, John Oman and Thomas Erskine (once called the \"Scottish Coleridge\") were all influenced by him.\\n\\n\\n== Political thinking ==\\nColeridge was also a profound political thinker.  While he began his life as a political radical, and an enthusiast for the French Revolution; over the years Coleridge developed a more conservative view of society, somewhat in the manner of Burke. Although seen as cowardly treachery by the next generation of Romantic poets, Coleridge\\'s later thought became a fruitful source for the evolving radicalism of J. S. Mill. Mill found three aspects of Coleridge\\'s thought especially illuminating:\\n\\nFirst, there was Coleridge\\'s insistence on what he called \"the Idea\" behind an institution – its social function, in later terminology – as opposed to the possible flaws in its actual implementation. Coleridge sought to understand meaning from within a social matrix, not outside it, using an imaginative reconstruction of the past (Verstehen) or of unfamiliar systems.\\nSecondly, Coleridge explored the necessary conditions for social stability – what he termed Permanence, in counterbalance to Progress, in a polity – stressing the importance of a shared public sense of community, and national education.\\nColeridge also usefully employed the organic metaphor of natural growth to shed light on the historical development of British history, as exemplified in the common law tradition – working his way thereby towards a sociology of jurisprudence.\\n\\n\\n== Collected works ==\\nThe current standard edition is The Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, edited by Kathleen Coburn and many others from 1969 to 2002.

       "  'Full text': 'Anna Laetitia Barbauld (, by herself possibly , as in French, née Aikin; 20 June 1743 – 9 March 1825) was a prominent English poet, essayist, literary critic, editor, and author of children\\'s literature.\\nA \"woman of letters\" who published in multiple genres, Barbauld had a successful writing career at a time when women rarely wrote professionally. She was a noted teacher at the Palgrave Academy and an innovative writer of works for children; her primers provided a model for more than a century. Her essays showed it was possible for a woman to be publicly engaged in politics; other women authors such as Elizabeth Benger emulated her. Barbauld\\'s literary career spanned numerous periods in British literary history: her work promoted the values of the Enlightenment and of sensibility, while her poetry made a founding contribution to the development of British Romanticism. Barbauld was also a literary critic. Her anthology of 18th-century novels helped to establish the canon as it is known today.\\nBarbauld\\'s career as a poet ended abruptly in 1812, with the publication of Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain\\'s participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children\\'s writer in the 19th century, and largely forgotten in the 20th, until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.\\n\\n\\n== Sources ==\\nMuch of what is known about Barbauld\\'s life comes from two memoirs, the first published in 1825 and written by her niece, Lucy Aikin, and the second published in 1874, written by her great-niece Anna Letitia Le Breton. Some letters from Barbauld to others also exist. However, a great many Barbauld family documents were lost in a fire that resulted from the London blitz in 1940.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nBarbauld was born on 20 June 1743 at Kibworth Harcourt in Leicestershire to Jane and John Aikin. She was named after her maternal grandmother and referred to as \"Nancy\" (a nickname for Anna). She was baptised by her mother\\'s brother, John Jennings, in Huntingdonshire two weeks after her birth. Barbauld\\'s father was headmaster of the dissenting academy in Kibworth Harcourt and minister at a nearby Presbyterian church. She spent her childhood in what Barbauld scholar William McCarthy describes as \"one of the best houses in Kibworth and in the very middle of the village square.\" She was much in the public eye, as the house was also a boys\\' school. The family had a comfortable standard of living. McCarthy suggests they may have ranked with large freeholders, well-to-do tradesmen, and manufacturers. At Barbauld\\'s father\\'s death in 1780, his estate was valued at more than £2,500.Barbauld commented to her husband in 1773: \"For the early part of my life I conversed little with my own Sex. In the Village where I was, there was none to converse with.\" Barbauld was surrounded by boys as a child and adopted their high spirits. Her mother attempted to subdue these, which would have been viewed as unseemly in a woman; according to Lucy Aikin\\'s memoir, what resulted was \"a double portion of bashfulness and maidenly reserve\" in Barbauld\\'s character. Barbauld was uncomfortable with her identity as a woman and believed she had failed to live up to the ideal of womanhood; much of her writing would focus on issues central to women, and her outsider perspective allowed her to question many of the traditional assumptions about femininity being made in the 18th century.Barbauld demanded that her father teach her the classics and after much pestering, he did. She had the opportunity to learn not only Latin and Greek, but French, Italian, and many other subjects generally deemed unnecessary for women at the time. Barbauld\\'s penchant for study worried her mother, who expected her to end up a spinster because of her intellectualism. The two were never so close as Barbauld and her father. Yet Barbauld\\'s mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter, \"I once indeed knew a little girl who was as eager to learn as her instructors could be to teach her, and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book, roundly, without spelling; and in half a year more could read as well as most women; but I never knew such another, and I believe never shall.\"Barbauld\\'s brother, John Aikin, described their father as \"the best parent, the wisest counsellor, the most affectionate friend, every thing that could command love and veneration\". Barbauld\\'s father prompted many such tributes, although Lucy Aikin described him as excessively modest and reserved. Barbauld developed a strong bond with her only sibling during childhood, standing in as a mother figure to him; they eventually became literary partners. In 1817, Joanna Baillie commented of their relationship: \"How few brothers and sisters have been to one another what they have been through so long a course of years!\"\\n\\nIn 1758, the family moved to Warrington Academy, halfway between the growing industrial cities of Liverpool and Manchester, where Barbauld\\'s father had been offered a teaching position. Some of the founders of the academy were members of Octagon Chapel, whose creedless and liberal \"Liverpool Liturgy\" formed a starting point for her beliefs and writings  The Academy drew many luminaries of the day, such as the natural philosopher and Unitarian theologian Joseph Priestley, and came to be known as \"the Athens of the North\" for its stimulating intellectual atmosphere. Another instructor may have been the French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat. School records suggest he taught French there in the 1770s. He may also have been a suitor to Barbauld – he allegedly wrote to John Aikin declaring his intention to become an English citizen and marry her. Archibald Hamilton Rowan also fell in love with Barbauld, describing her later as \"possessed of great beauty, distinct traces of which she retained to the latest of her life. Her person was slender, her complexion exquisitely fair with the bloom of perfect health; her features regular and elegant, and her dark blue eyes beamed with the light of wit and fancy.\" Despite her mother\\'s anxiety, Barbauld received many offers of marriage around this time – all of which she declined.\\n\\n\\n== First literary successes and marriage ==\\n\\nIn 1773, Barbauld brought out her first book of poems, after her friends had praised them and convinced her to publish them. The collection, entitled simply Poems, went through four editions in a single year and surprised Barbauld by its success. Barbauld became a respected literary figure in England on the reputation of Poems alone. In the same year, she and her brother, John Aikin, jointly published Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose, which was also well received. The essays in it (most of which were by Barbauld) were favourably compared to those of Samuel Johnson.In May 1774, despite some \"misgivings\", Barbauld married Rochemont Barbauld (1749–1808), the grandson of a French Huguenot and a former pupil at Warrington. According to Barbauld\\'s niece, Lucy Aikin:\\n\\n[H]er attachment to Mr. Barbauld was the illusion of a romantic fancy – not of a tender heart. Had her true affections been early called forth by a more genial home atmosphere, she would never have allowed herself to be caught by crazy demonstrations of amorous rapture, set off with theatrical French manners, or have conceived of such exaggerated passion as a safe foundation on which to raise the sober structure of domestic happiness. My father ascribed that ill-starred union in great part to the baleful influence of [Jean-Jacques Rousseau\\'s] \\'Nouvelle Heloise,\\' Mr. B. impersonating St. Preux. [Barbauld] was informed by a true friend that he had experienced one attack of insanity, and was urged to break off the engagement on that account. – \"Then,\" answered she, \"if I were now to disappoint him, he would certainly go mad.\" To this there could be no reply; and with a kind of desperate generosity she rushed upon her melancholy destiny.\\nAfter the wedding, the couple moved to Suffolk, near where Rochemont had been offered a congregation and a school for boys. Barbauld took this time and rewrote some of the psalms, a common pastime in the 18th century, publishing them as Devotional Pieces Compiled from the Psalms and the Book of Job. Attached to this work is her essay \"Thoughts on the Devotional Taste, on Sects and on Establishments\", which explains her theory of religious feeling and the problems inherent in institutionalising religion.\\n\\nIt seems that Barbauld and her husband were concerned that they would never have a child of their own, and in 1775, after only a year of marriage, Barbauld suggested to her brother that they adopt one of his children:I am sensible it is not a small thing we ask; nor can it be easy for a parent to part with a child. This I would say, from a number, one may more easily be spared. Though it makes a very material difference in happiness whether a person has children or no children, it makes, I apprehend, little or none whether he has three, or four; five, or six; because four or five are enow to exercise all his whole stock of care and affection. We should gain, but you would not lose.\\nAfter a time, her brother conceded and the couple adopted Charles. it was for him that Barbauld wrote her most famous books: Lessons for Children (1778–79) and Hymns in Prose for Children (1781).\\n\\n\\n== Palgrave Academy ==\\n\\nBarbauld and her husband spent eleven years teaching at Palgrave Academy in Suffolk. Early on, Barbauld was responsible not only for running her own household, but also the school\\'s, to which she served as accountant, maid, and housekeeper. The school opened with only eight boys, but the number had risen to about forty by the time the Barbaulds left in 1785, which reflects the excellent reputation the school had acquired. The Barbaulds\\' educational philosophy attracted Dissenters as well as Anglicans. Palgrave replaced the strict discipline of traditional schools such as Eton, which often used corporal punishment, with a system of \"fines and jobations\" and even, it seems likely, \"juvenile trials,\" that is, trials run by and for the students themselves. Moreover, instead of the traditional classical studies, the school offered a practical curriculum that stressed science and the modern languages. Barbauld herself taught the foundation subjects of reading and religion to the youngest boys, and geography, history, composition, rhetoric and science to higher grade levels. She was a dedicated teacher, producing a \"weekly chronicle\" for the school and writing theatrical pieces for the students to perform. Barbauld had a profound effect on many of her students. One who went on to great success was William Taylor, a pre-eminent scholar of German literature, who referred to Barbauld as \"the mother of his mind.\"\\n\\n\\n== Political involvement and Hampstead ==\\n\\nIn September 1785, the Barbaulds left Palgrave for a tour of France. By this time Rochemont\\'s mental health was deteriorating and he was no longer able to carry out his teaching duties. In 1787, they moved to Hampstead, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel. It was here that Barbauld became close friends with Joanna Baillie, the playwright. Although no longer in charge of a school, the Barbaulds did not abandon their commitment to education; they often boarded one or two pupils recommended by personal friends.During this time, the heyday of the French Revolution, Barbauld published her most radical political pieces. From 1787 to 1790, Charles James Fox attempted to convince the House of Commons to pass a law granting Dissenters full citizenship rights. When this bill was defeated for the third time, Barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets, An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts (see Test Act). Readers were shocked to discover that such a well-reasoned argument should come from a woman. In 1791, after William Wilberforce\\'s attempt to outlaw the slave trade had failed, Barbauld published her Epistle to William Wilberforce Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade, which not only lamented the fate of the slaves, but warned of the cultural and social degeneration the British could expect if they did not abandon slavery. In 1792, she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti-war sermon entitled Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation: \"We are called upon to repent of national sins, because we can help them, and because we ought to help them.\"\\n\\n\\n== Stoke Newington: an end to a literary career ==\\nIn 1802, the Barbaulds moved to Stoke Newington, where Rochemont took over the pastoral duties of the Unitarian Chapel at Newington Green. Barbauld herself was happy to be nearer her brother, John, as her husband\\'s mind was rapidly failing. Rochemont developed a \"violent antipathy to his wife and he was liable to fits of insane fury directed against her. One day at dinner he seized a knife and chased her round the table so that she only saved herself by jumping out of the window.\" Such scenes repeated themselves to Barbauld\\'s great sadness and real danger, but she refused to leave him. Rochemont drowned himself in the nearby New River in 1808 and Barbauld was overcome with grief. When she returned to writing, she produced the radical poem Eighteen Hundred and Eleven (1812), which depicted England as a ruin. It was reviewed so viciously that Barbauld never published another work in her lifetime, although it is now often viewed by scholars as her greatest poetic achievement. She died in 1825, a renowned writer, and was buried in the family vault in St Mary\\'s, Stoke Newington. After her death, a marble tablet was erected in the Newington Green Chapel with the following inscription:\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n \\nAt her death, Barbauld was lauded in the Newcastle Magazine as \"unquestionably the first [i.e., best] of our female poets, and one of the most eloquent and powerful of our prose writers\" and the Imperial Magazine declared \"so long as letters shall be cultivated in Britain, or wherever the English language shall be known, so long will the name of this lady be respected.\" She was favourably compared to both Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson – no mean feat for a woman writer in the 18th century. By 1925, however, she was remembered only as a moralising writer for children, if that. It was not until the advent of feminist literary criticism in the academic world of the 1970s and 1980s that Barbauld finally began to be included in literary history.\\nBarbauld\\'s remarkable disappearance from the literary landscape took place for a number of reasons. One of the most important was the disdain heaped upon her by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, poets who in their youthful, radical days had looked to her poetry for inspiration, but in their later, conservative years dismissed her work. Once these poets had become canonised, their opinions held sway. Moreover, the intellectual ferment of which Barbauld was an important part of – particularly at the Dissenting academies – had by the end of the 19th century come to be associated with the \"philistine\" middle class, as Matthew Arnold put it. The reformist 18th-century middle class was later held responsible for the excesses and abuses of the industrial age. Finally, the Victorians viewed Barbauld as \"an icon of sentimental saintliness\" and \"erased her political courage, her tough mindedness, [and] her talent for humor and irony\", to arrive at a literary figure that modernists despised.As literary studies developed into a discipline at the end of the 19th century, the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it. According to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman – one who was angry, who resisted the gender roles of her time, and who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories. Indeed, it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice that Barbauld had contributed.\\nBarbauld\\'s works fell out of print and no full-length scholarly biography of her was written until William McCarthy\\'s Anna Letitia Barbauld: Voice of the Enlightenment in 2009.Barbauld\\'s adopted son Charles grew up to be a doctor and chemist. He married a daughter of Gilbert Wakefield. Their child, Anna Letitia Le Breton, wrote literary memoirs, which included a Memoir of Mrs. Barbauld, including Letters and Notices of her Family and Friends in 1874.\\n\\n\\n== Literary analysis ==\\n\\n\\n=== Poetry ===\\n\\nBarbauld\\'s wide-ranging poetry has been read primarily by feminist literary critics interested in recovering women writers important in their own time, but forgotten in literary history. Isobel Armstrong\\'s work represents one way to do such a study; she argues that Barbauld, like other Romantic women poets:\\n\\n... neither consented to the idea of a special feminine discourse nor accepted an account of themselves as belonging to the realm of the nonrational. They engaged with two strategies to deal with the problem of affective discourse. First, they used the customary \\'feminine\\' forms and languages, but they turned them to analytical account and used them to think with. Second, they challenged the male philosophical traditions that led to a demeaning discourse of feminine experience and remade those traditions.\\nIn her subsequent analysis of \"Inscription for an Ice-House\" Armstrong points to Barbauld\\'s challenge of Edmund Burke\\'s characterisation of the sublime and the beautiful and Adam Smith\\'s economic theories in the Wealth of Nations as evidence for this interpretation.\\n\\nThe work of Marlon Ross and Anne K. Mellor represents a second way to apply the insights of feminist theory to the recovery of women writers. They argue that Barbauld and other Romantic women poets carved out a distinctive feminine voice in the literary sphere. As a woman and a dissenter, Barbauld had a unique perspective on society, according to Ross, and it was this specific position that obliged her to publish social commentary. Ross points out, however, that women were in a double bind: \"They could choose to speak politics in nonpolitical modes, and thus risk greatly diminishing the clarity and pointedness of their political passion, or they could choose literary modes that were overtly political while trying to infuse them with a recognizable \\'feminine\\' decorum, again risking a softening of their political agenda.\" So Barbauld and other Romantic women poets often wrote \"occasional poems\". These had traditionally commented, often satirically, on national events, but by the end of the 18th century were increasingly serious and personal. Women wrote sentimental poems, a style then much in vogue, on personal occasions such as the birth of a child and argued that in commenting on the small occurrences of daily life, they would establish a moral foundation for the nation. Scholars such as Ross and Mellor maintain that this adaptation of existing styles and genres is one way in which women poets created a feminine Romanticism.\\n\\n\\n=== Political essays and poems ===\\n\\nBarbauld\\'s most significant political texts are: An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts (1790), Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade (1791), Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation (1793), and Eighteen Hundred and Eleven (1812). As Harriet Guest explains, \"The theme Barbauld\\'s essays of the 1790s repeatedly return to is that of the constitution of the public as a religious, civic, and national body, and she is always concerned to emphasize the continuity between the rights of private individuals and those of the public defined in capaciously inclusive terms.\"For three years, from 1787 to 1790, Dissenters had been attempting to convince Parliament to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, which limited the civil rights of Dissenters. After the repeal was voted down for the third time, Barbauld burst onto the public stage after \"nine years of silence\". Her highly charged pamphlet is written in a biting and sarcastic tone. It opens, \"We thank you for the compliment paid the Dissenters, when you suppose that the moment they are eligible to places of power and profit, all such places will at once be filled with them.\" She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: \"We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects.\" Moreover, she contends that it is precisely the isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out, not anything inherent in their form of worship. Finally, appealing to British patriotism, she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip the English in extending liberty.In the following year, after one of William Wilberforce\\'s many efforts to suppress the slave trade failed to pass Parliament, Barbauld wrote her Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade (1791). In it, she calls Britain to account for the sin of slavery. She condemns in harsh tones the \"avarice\" of a country content to allow its wealth and prosperity to be supported by the labour of enslaved human beings. Moreover, she draws a picture of the plantation mistress and master that reveals all of the failings of the \"colonial enterprise: [an] indolent, voluptuous, monstrous woman\" and a \"degenerate, enfeebled man\".In 1793, when the British government called on the nation to fast in honour of the war, anti-war Dissenters such as Barbauld were left with a moral quandary: \"Obey the order and violate their consciences by praying for success in a war they disapproved? observe the Fast, but preach against the war? defy the Proclamation and refuse to take any part in the Fast?\" Barbauld took this opportunity to write a sermon, Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation, on the moral responsibility of the individual. For her, each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation because he or she constitutes part of the nation. The essay attempts to determine what the proper role of the individual is in the state, and while she argues that \"insubordination\" can undermine a government, she admits there are lines of \"conscience\" that cannot be crossed in obeying a government. The text has been seen as a classic consideration of the idea of an \"unjust war\".\\nIn Eighteen Hundred and Eleven (1812), written after Britain had been at war with France for a decade and was on the brink of losing the Napoleonic Wars, Barbauld presented a shocking Juvenalian satire: she argued that the British Empire was waning and the American Empire waxing. It is to America that Britain\\'s wealth and fame will now go, she contended, and Britain will become a mere empty ruin. She tied this decline directly to Britain\\'s participation in the Napoleonic Wars:\\n\\nNot surprisingly, this pessimistic view of the future was poorly received: \"Reviews, whether in liberal or conservative magazines, ranged from cautious to patronizingly negative to outrageously abusive.\" Barbauld, stunned by the reaction, retreated from the public eye. Even when Britain was on the verge of winning the war, Barbauld could not be joyous. She wrote to a friend, \"I do not know how to rejoice at this victory, splendid as it is, over Buonaparte, when I consider the horrible waste of life, the mass of misery, which such gigantic combats must occasion.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Children\\'s literature ===\\n\\nBarbauld\\'s Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose for Children made a revolution in children\\'s literature. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered. Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins so that children could easily read them, and even more importantly, she developed a style of \"informal dialogue between parent and child\" that would dominate children\\'s literature for a generation. In Lessons for Children, a four-volume, age-adapted reading primer, Barbauld employs the concept of a mother teaching her son. It is more than likely that many of the events in these stories were inspired by Barbauld\\'s experience of teaching her own son, Charles. The series is far more than a way to acquire literacy – it also introduces the reader to \"elements of society\\'s symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility.\" Moreover, it exposes the child to the principles of \"botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [and] astronomy.\" The series was relatively popular. Maria Edgeworth commented in the educational treatise that she co-authored with her father, Practical Education (1798): it is \"one of the best books for young people from seven to ten years old, that has yet appeared.\"Some at the time saw Barbauld\\'s work as marking a shift in children\\'s literature from fantasy to didacticism. Sarah Burney, in her popular novel Traits of Nature (1812), has the 14-year-old Christina Cleveland remark, \"Well, then; you know fairy-tales are forbidden pleasures in all modern school-rooms. Mrs. Barbauld, and Mrs. Trimmer, and Miss Edgeworth, and a hundred others, have written good books for children, which have thrown poor Mother Goose, and the Arabian Nights, quite out of favour; – at least, with papas and mamas.\" A more strident criticism was made by the Lambs, telling of Mary\\'s abortive search for a copy of Goody Two Shoes, which her brother claimed was because \"Mrs. Barbauld\\'s stuff has banished all the old classics of the nursery.\"Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose had, for children\\'s books, an unprecedented impact; not only did they influence the poetry of William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Jane Taylor, they were also used to teach several generations of schoolchildren. Children\\'s literature scholar William McCarthy states, \"Elizabeth Barrett Browning could still quote the opening lines of Lessons for Children at age thirty-nine.\" Although both Samuel Johnson and Charles James Fox ridiculed Barbauld\\'s children\\'s books and believed that she was wasting her talents, Barbauld herself saw such writing as noble and encouraged others to follow her. As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer explains, \"She gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature, and by not lowering her standard of writing for children, she inspired others to write on a similar high standard.\" In fact, because of Barbauld, Sarah Trimmer and Hannah More were inspired to write for poor children as well as organise a large-scale Sunday School movement, Ellenor Fenn to write and design a series of readers and games for middle-class children, and Richard Lovell Edgeworth to begin one of the first systematic studies of childhood development, which would culminate in an educational treatise authored by Maria Edgeworth and him, and in a large body of children\\'s stories by Maria.\\n\\nBarbauld also collaborated with her brother John Aikin on the six-volume series Evenings at Home (1793). It is a miscellany of stories, fables, dramas, poems, and dialogues. In many ways this series encapsulates the ideals of an Enlightenment education: \"curiosity, observation, and reasoning.\" For example, the stories encourage the learning of science through hands-on activities: in \"A Tea Lecture\" the child learns that tea-making is \"properly an operation of chemistry\" and lessons on evaporation, and condensation follow. The text also emphasises rationality: in \"Things by Their Right Names,\" a child demands that his father tell him a story about \"a bloody murder.\" The father does so, using some of the fictional tropes of fairy tales such as \"once upon a time\", but confounding his son with details, such as the murderers all \"had steel caps on.\" In the end the child realises his father has told him the story of a battle, and his father comments \"I do not know of any murders half so bloody.\" Both the tactic of defamiliarising the world to force the reader to think about it rationally, along with the anti-war message of this tale, prevail throughout Evenings at Home. In fact, Michelle Levy, a scholar of the period, argued that the series encouraged readers to \"become critical observers of and, where necessary, vocal resisters to authority.\" This resistance is learned and practised in the home; according to Levy, \"Evenings at Home... makes the claim that social and political reform must begin in the family.\" It is families that are responsible for the nation\\'s progress or regression.\\nAccording to Lucy Aikin, Barbauld\\'s niece, Barbauld\\'s contributions to Evenings at Home consisted of the following pieces: \"The Young Mouse,\" \"The Wasp and Bee,\" \"Alfred, a drama,\" \"Animals and Countries,\" \"Canute\\'s Reproof,\" \"The Masque of Nature,\" \"Things by their right Names,\" \"The Goose and Horse,\" \"On Manufactures,\" \"The Flying-fish,\" \"A Lesson in the Art of Distinguishing,\" \"The Phoenix and Dove,\" \"The Manufacture of Paper,\" \"The Four Sisters,\" and \"Live Dolls.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Editorial work ===\\nBarbauld edited several major works towards the end of her life, all of which helped to shape the canon as known today. First, in 1804, she edited Samuel Richardson\\'s correspondence and wrote an extensive biographical introduction of the man who was perhaps the most influential novelist of the 18th century. Her \"212-page essay on his life and works [was] the first substantial Richardson biography.\" The following year she edited Selections from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, and Freeholder, with a Preliminary Essay, a volume of essays emphasising \"wit\", \"manners\" and \"taste\". In 1811, she assembled The Female Speaker, an anthology of literature chosen specifically for young girls. Because, according to Barbauld\\'s philosophy, what one reads when one is young is formative, she carefully considered the \"delicacy\" of her female readers and \"direct[ed] her choice to subjects more particularly appropriate to the duties, the employments, and the dispositions of the softer sex.\" The anthology is subdivided into sections such as \"moral and didactic pieces\" and \"descriptive and pathetic pieces\"; it includes poetry and prose by, among others, Alexander Pope, Hannah More, Maria Edgeworth, Samuel Johnson, James Thomson and Hester Chapone.\\nBarbauld\\'s 50-volume series of The British Novelists, published in 1810 with a broad introductory essay on the history of the novel, allowed her to place her mark on literary history. It was \"the first English edition to make comprehensive critical and historical claims\" and was in every respect \"a canon-making enterprise\". In an insightful essay, Barbauld legitimises the novel, then still a controversial genre, by connecting it to ancient Persian and Greek literature. For her, a good novel is \"an epic in prose, with more of character and less (indeed in modern novels nothing) of the supernatural machinery.\" Barbauld maintains that novel-reading has a multiplicity of benefits. Not only is it a \"domestic pleasure\", but it is also a way to \"infus[e] principles and moral feelings\" into the population. Barbauld also provided introductions to each of the fifty authors included in the series.\\n\\n\\n== List of works ==\\nUnless otherwise noted, this list is taken from Wolicky\\'s entry on Barbauld in the Dictionary of Literary Biography (each year with a link connects to its corresponding \"[year] in literature\" article, for verse works, or \"[year] in literature\" article, for prose or mixed prose and verse):\\n\\n1768: Corsica: An Ode\\n1773: Poems, Poems. 1777.\\n1773: Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose (with John Aikin)\\n1775: Devotional Pieces, Compiled from the Psalms and the Book of the Job\\n1778: Lessons for Children from Two to Three Years Old (London: J.

       "  'Full text': 'Mary Wollstonecraft (, also UK: ; 27 April 1759 – 10 September 1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of women\\'s rights. Until the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft\\'s life, which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships at the time, received more attention than her writing. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and her works as important influences.\\nDuring her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children\\'s book. Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason.\\nAfter Wollstonecraft\\'s death, her widower published a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. However, with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft\\'s advocacy of women\\'s equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important.\\nAfter two ill-fated affairs, with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. She died eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter, Mary Shelley, who would become an accomplished writer and author of Frankenstein.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life ===\\nWollstonecraft was born on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was the second of the seven children of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft\\'s youth. The family\\'s financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft\\'s father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother\\'s bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.Two friendships shaped Wollstonecraft\\'s early life. The first was with Jane Arden in Beverley. The two frequently read books together and attended lectures presented by Arden\\'s father, a self-styled philosopher and scientist. Wollstonecraft revelled in the intellectual atmosphere of the Arden household and valued her friendship with Arden greatly, sometimes to the point of being emotionally possessive. Wollstonecraft wrote to her: \"I have formed romantic notions of friendship ... I am a little singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none.\" In some of Wollstonecraft\\'s letters to Arden, she reveals the volatile and depressive emotions that would haunt her throughout her life. The second and more important friendship was with Fanny (Frances) Blood, introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind.Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck out on her own in 1778 and accepted a job as a lady\\'s companion to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in Bath. However, Wollstonecraft had trouble getting along with the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in Thoughts on the Education of Daughters, 1787). In 1780 she returned home upon being called back to care for her dying mother. Rather than return to Dawson\\'s employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to Fanny and her family throughout her life (she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood\\'s brother, for example).Wollstonecraft had envisioned living in a female utopia with Blood; they made plans to rent rooms together and support each other emotionally and financially, but this dream collapsed under economic realities. In order to make a living, Wollstonecraft, her sisters, and Blood set up a school together in Newington Green, a Dissenting community. Blood soon became engaged and after their marriage her husband, Hugh Skeys, took her to Lisbon, Portugal, to improve her health, which had always been precarious. Despite the change of surroundings Blood\\'s health further deteriorated when she became pregnant, and in 1785 Wollstonecraft left the school and followed Blood to nurse her, but to no avail. Moreover, her abandonment of the school led to its failure. Blood\\'s death devastated Wollstonecraft and was part of the inspiration for her first novel, Mary: A Fiction (1788).\\n\\n\\n=== \\'The first of a new genus\\' ===\\n\\nAfter Blood\\'s death in 1785, Wollstonecraft\\'s friends helped her obtain a position as governess to the daughters of the Anglo-Irish Kingsborough family in Ireland. Although she could not get along with Lady Kingsborough, the children found her an inspiring instructor; Margaret King would later say she \\'had freed her mind from all superstitions\\'. Some of Wollstonecraft\\'s experiences during this year would make their way into her only children\\'s book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788).Frustrated by the limited career options open to respectable yet poor women—an impediment which Wollstonecraft eloquently describes in the chapter of Thoughts on the Education of Daughters entitled \\'Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left Without a Fortune\\'—she decided, after only a year as a governess, to embark upon a career as an author. This was a radical choice, since, at the time, few women could support themselves by writing. As she wrote to her sister Everina in 1787, she was trying to become \\'the first of a new genus\\'. She moved to London and, assisted by the liberal publisher Joseph Johnson, found a place to live and work to support herself. She learned French and German and translated texts, most notably Of the Importance of Religious Opinions by Jacques Necker and Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children by Christian Gotthilf Salzmann. She also wrote reviews, primarily of novels, for Johnson\\'s periodical, the Analytical Review. Wollstonecraft\\'s intellectual universe expanded during this time, not only from the reading that she did for her reviews but also from the company she kept: she attended Johnson\\'s famous dinners and met such luminaries as the radical pamphleteer Thomas Paine and the philosopher William Godwin. The first time Godwin and Wollstonecraft met, they were disappointed in each other. Godwin had come to hear Paine, but Wollstonecraft assailed him all night long, disagreeing with him on nearly every subject. Johnson himself, however, became much more than a friend; she described him in her letters as a father and a brother.While in London, Wollstonecraft pursued a relationship with the artist Henry Fuseli, even though he was already married. She was, she wrote, enraptured by his genius, \\'the grandeur of his soul, that quickness of comprehension, and lovely sympathy\\'. She proposed a platonic living arrangement with Fuseli and his wife, but Fuseli\\'s wife was appalled, and he broke off the relationship with Wollstonecraft. After Fuseli\\'s rejection, Wollstonecraft decided to travel to France to escape the humiliation of the incident, and to participate in the revolutionary events that she had just celebrated in her recent Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790). She had written the Rights of Men in response to the Whig MP Edmund Burke\\'s politically conservative critique of the French Revolution in Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) and it made her famous overnight. Reflections on the Revolution in France was published on 1 November 1790, and so angered Wollstonecraft that she spent the rest of the month writing her rebuttal. A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke was published on 29 November 1790, initially anonymously; the second edition of A Vindication of the Rights of Men was published on 18 December, and this time the publisher revealed Wollstonecraft as the author.Wollstonecraft called the French Revolution a \\'glorious chance to obtain more virtue and happiness than hitherto blessed our globe\\'. Against Burke\\'s dismissal of the Third Estate as men of no account, Wollstonecraft wrote, \\'Time may show, that this obscure throng knew more of the human heart and of legislation than the profligates of rank, emasculated by hereditary effeminacy\\'. About the events of 5–6 October 1789, when the royal family was marched from Versailles to Paris by a group of angry housewives, Burke praised Queen Marie Antoinette as a symbol of the refined elegance of the ancien régime, who was surrounded by \\'furies from hell, in the abused shape of the vilest of women\\'. Wollstonecraft by contrast wrote of the same event: \\'Probably you [Burke] mean women who gained a livelihood by selling vegetables or fish, who never had any advantages of education\\'.Wollstonecraft was compared with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist Joseph Priestley and Paine, whose Rights of Man (1791) would prove to be the most popular of the responses to Burke. She pursued the ideas she had outlined in Rights of Men in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), her most famous and influential work. Wollstonecraft\\'s fame extended across the English channel, for when the French statesmen Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord visited London in 1792, he visited her, during which she asked that French girls be given the same right to an education that French boys were being offered by the new regime in France.\\n\\n\\n=== France ===\\n\\nWollstonecraft left for Paris in December 1792 and arrived about a month before Louis XVI was guillotined. Britain and France were on the brink of war when she left for Paris, and many advised her not to go. France was in turmoil. She sought out other British visitors such as Helen Maria Williams and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city. During her time in Paris, Wollstonecraft associated mostly with the moderate Girondins rather than the more radical Jacobins.On 26 December 1792, Wollstonecraft saw the former king, Louis XVI, being taken to be tried before the National Assembly, and much to her own surprise, found \\'the tears flow[ing] insensibly from my eyes, when I saw Louis sitting, with more dignity than I expected from his character, in a hackney coach going to meet death, where so many of his race have triumphed\\'.France declared war on Britain in February 1793. Wollstonecraft tried to leave France for Switzerland but was denied permission. In March, the Jacobin-dominated Committee of Public Safety came to power, instituting a totalitarian regime meant to mobilise France for the first \\'total war\\'.\\nLife became very difficult for foreigners in France. At first, they were put under police surveillance and, to get a residency permit, had to produce six written statements from Frenchmen testifying to their loyalty to the republic. Then, on 12 April 1793, all foreigners were forbidden to leave France. Despite her sympathy for the revolution, life for Wollstonecraft become very uncomfortable, all the more so as the Girondins had lost out to the Jacobins. Some of Wollstonecraft\\'s French friends lost their heads to the guillotine as the Jacobins set out to annihilate their enemies.\\n\\n\\n=== Gilbert Imlay, the Reign of Terror, and her first child ===\\nHaving just written the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft was determined to put her ideas to the test, and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the French Revolution, she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet: she met and fell passionately in love with Gilbert Imlay, an American adventurer. Wollstonecraft put her own principles in practice by sleeping with Imlay even though they were not married, which was unacceptable behavior from a \\'respectable\\' British woman. Whether or not she was interested in marriage, he was not, and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealisation of the man. Despite her rejection of the sexual component of relationships in the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft discovered that Imlay awakened her interest in sex.Wollstonecraft was to a certain extent disillusioned by what she saw in France, writing that the people under the republic still behaved slavishly to those who held power while the government remained \\'venal\\' and \\'brutal\\'. Despite her disenchantment, Wollstonecraft wrote:\\n\\nI cannot yet give up the hope, that a fairer day is dawning on Europe, though I must hesitatingly observe, that little is to be expected from the narrow principle of commerce, which seems everywhere to be shoving aside the point of honour of the noblesse [nobility]. For the same pride of office, the same desire of power are still visible; with this aggravation, that, fearing to return to obscurity, after having but just acquired a relish for distinction, each hero, or philosopher, for all are dubbed with these new titles, endeavors to make hay while the sun shines.\\nWollstonecraft was offended by the Jacobins\\' treatment of women. They refused to grant women equal rights, denounced \\'Amazons\\', and made it clear that women were supposed to conform to Jean-Jacques Rousseau\\'s ideal of helpers to men. On 16 October 1793, Marie Antoinette was guillotined; among her charges and convictions, she was found guilty of committing incest with her son. Though Wollstonecraft disliked the former queen, she was troubled that the Jacobins would make Marie Antoinette\\'s alleged perverse sexual acts one of the central reasons for the French people to hate her.As the daily arrests and executions of the Reign of Terror began, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion. She was, after all, a British citizen known to be a friend of leading Girondins. On 31 October 1793, most of the Girondin leaders were guillotined; when Imlay broke the news to Wollstonecraft, she fainted. By this time, Imlay was taking advantage of the British blockade of France, which had caused shortages and worsened ever-growing inflation, by chartering ships to bring food and soap from America and dodge the British Royal Navy, goods that he could sell at a premium to Frenchmen who still had money. Imlay\\'s blockade-running gained the respect and support of some Jacobins, ensuring, as he had hoped, his freedom during the Terror. To protect Wollstonecraft from arrest, Imlay made a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her an American citizen. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined. Her sisters believed she had been imprisoned.\\nWollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins \\'nightmarish\\'. There were gigantic daytime parades requiring everyone to show themselves and lustily cheer lest they be suspected of inadequate commitment to the republic, as well as nighttime police raids to arrest \\'enemies of the republic\\'. In a March 1794 letter to her sister Everina, Wollstonecraft wrote:\\n\\nIt is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind ... death and misery, in every shape of terrour, haunts this devoted country—I certainly am glad that I came to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded.\\nWollstonecraft soon became pregnant by Imlay, and on 14 May 1794 she gave birth to her first child, Fanny, naming her after perhaps her closest friend. Wollstonecraft was overjoyed; she wrote to a friend, \\'My little Girl begins to suck so MANFULLY that her father reckons saucily on her writing the second part of the R[igh]ts of Woman\\' (emphasis hers). She continued to write avidly, despite not only her pregnancy and the burdens of being a new mother alone in a foreign country, but also the growing tumult of the French Revolution. While at Le Havre in northern France, she wrote a history of the early revolution, An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution, which was published in London in December 1794. Imlay, unhappy with the domestic-minded and maternal Wollstonecraft, eventually left her. He promised that he would return to her and Fanny at Le Havre, but his delays in writing to her and his long absences convinced Wollstonecraft that he had found another woman. Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations, which most critics explain as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman, while others say they resulted from her circumstances—a foreign woman alone with an infant in the middle of a revolution that had seen good friends imprisoned or executed.\\n\\n\\n=== The fall of the Jacobins and An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution ===\\nIn July 1794, Wollstonecraft welcomed the fall of the Jacobins, predicting it would be followed with a restoration of freedom of the press in France, which led her to return to Paris. In August 1794, Imlay departed for London and promised to return soon. In 1793, the British government had begun a crackdown on radicals, suspending civil liberties, imposing drastic censorship, and trying for treason anyone suspected of sympathy with the revolution, which led Wollstonecraft to fear she would be imprisoned if she returned.The winter of 1794–95 was the coldest winter in Europe for over a century, which reduced Wollstonecraft and her daughter Fanny to desperate circumstances. The river Seine froze that winter, which made it impossible for ships to bring food and coal to Paris, leading to widespread starvation and deaths from the cold in the city. Wollstonecraft continued to write to Imlay, asking him to return to France at once, declaring she still had faith in the revolution and did not wish to return to Britain. After she left France on 7 April 1795, she continued to refer to herself as \\'Mrs Imlay\\', even to her sisters, in order to bestow legitimacy upon her child.The British historian Tom Furniss called An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution the most neglected of Wollstonecraft\\'s books. It was first published in London in 1794, but a second edition did not appear until 1989. Later generations were more interested in her feminist writings rather than her account of the French Revolution, which Furniss has called her \\'best work\\'. Wollstonecraft was not trained as a historian, but she used all sorts of journals, letters and documents recounting how ordinary people in France reacted to the revolution. She was trying to counteract what Furniss called the \\'hysterical\\' anti-revolutionary mood in Britain, which depicted the revolution as due to the entire French nation\\'s going mad. Wollstonecraft argued instead that the revolution arose from a set of social, economic and political conditions that left no other way out of the crisis that gripped France in 1789.An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution was a difficult balancing act for Wollstonecraft. She condemned the Jacobin regime and the Reign of Terror, but at same time she argued that the revolution was a great achievement, which led her to stop her history in late 1789 rather than write about the Terror of 1793–94. Edmund Burke had ended his Reflections on the Revolution in France with reference to the events of 5–6 October 1789, when a group of women from Paris forced the French royal family from the Palace of Versailles to Paris. Burke called the women \\'furies from hell\\', while Wollstonecraft defended them as ordinary housewives angry about the lack of bread to feed their families. Against Burke\\'s idealised portrait of Marie Antoinette as a noble victim of a mob, Wollstonecraft portrayed the queen as a femme fatale, a seductive, scheming and dangerous woman. Wollstonecraft argued that the values of the aristocracy corrupted women in a monarchy because women\\'s main purpose in such a society was to bear sons to continue a dynasty, which essentially reduced a woman\\'s value to her womb. Moreover, Wollstonecraft pointed out that unless a queen was a queen regnant, most queens were queen consorts, which meant a woman had to exercise influence via her husband or son, encouraging her to become more and more manipulative. Wollstonecraft argued that aristocratic values, by emphasising a woman\\'s body and her ability to be charming over her mind and character, had encouraged women like Marie Antoinette to be manipulative and ruthless, making the queen into a corrupted and corrupting product of the ancien régime.\\n\\n\\n=== England and William Godwin ===\\nSeeking Imlay, Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795, but he rejected her. In May 1795 she attempted to commit suicide, probably with laudanum, but Imlay saved her life (although it is unclear how). In a last attempt to win back Imlay, she embarked upon some business negotiations for him in Scandinavia, trying to recoup some of his losses. Wollstonecraft undertook this hazardous trip with only her young daughter and a maid. She recounted her travels and thoughts in letters to Imlay, many of which were eventually published as Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark in 1796. When she returned to England and came to the full realization that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide for the second time, leaving a note for Imlay:\\n\\nLet my wrongs sleep with me! Soon, very soon, shall I be at peace. When you receive this, my burning head will be cold ... I shall plunge into the Thames where there is the least chance of my being snatched from the death I seek. God bless you! May you never know by experience what you have made me endure. Should your sensibility ever awake, remorse will find its way to your heart; and, in the midst of business and sensual pleasure, I shall appear before you, the victim of your deviation from rectitude.\\n\\nShe then went out on a rainy night and \"to make her clothes heavy with water, she walked up and down about half an hour\" before jumping into the River Thames, but a stranger saw her jump and rescued her. Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, which was one of the calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.\\nGradually, Wollstonecraft returned to her literary life, becoming involved with Joseph Johnson\\'s circle again, in particular with Mary Hays, Elizabeth Inchbald, and Sarah Siddons through William Godwin. Godwin and Wollstonecraft\\'s unique courtship began slowly, but it eventually became a passionate love affair. Godwin had read her Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and later wrote that \"If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration.\" Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise Political Justice. After their marriage on 29 March 1797, Godwin and Wollstonecraft moved to 29 The Polygon, Somers Town. Godwin rented an apartment 20 doors away at 17 Evesham Buildings in Chalton Street as a study, so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by letter. By all accounts, theirs was a happy and stable, though brief, relationship.\\n\\n\\n=== Birth of Mary, death ===\\n\\nOn 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second daughter, Mary. Although the delivery seemed to go well initially, the placenta broke apart during the birth and became infected; childbed fever was a common and often fatal occurrence in the eighteenth century. After several days of agony, Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September. Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft, \"I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again.\" She was buried at Old Saint Pancras Churchyard, where her tombstone reads, \"Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: Born 27 April 1759: Died 10 September 1797.\"\\n\\n\\n== Posthumous, Godwin\\'s Memoirs ==\\nIn January 1798 Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Although Godwin felt that he was portraying his wife with love, compassion, and sincerity, many readers were shocked that he would reveal Wollstonecraft\\'s illegitimate children, love affairs, and suicide attempts. The Romantic poet Robert Southey accused him of \"the want of all feeling in stripping his dead wife naked\" and vicious satires such as The Unsex\\'d Females were published. Godwin\\'s Memoirs portrays Wollstonecraft as a woman deeply invested in feeling who was balanced by his reason and as more of a religious sceptic than her own writings suggest. Godwin\\'s views of Wollstonecraft were perpetuated throughout the nineteenth century and resulted in poems such as \"Wollstonecraft and Fuseli\" by British poet Robert Browning and that by William Roscoe which includes the lines:\\n\\nIn 1851, Wollstonecraft\\'s remains were moved by her grandson Percy Florence Shelley to his family tomb in St Peter\\'s Church, Bournemouth. Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north-east of the church just north of Sir John Soane\\'s grave. Her husband was buried with her on his death in 1836, as was his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin (1766–1841).\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\nWollstonecraft has what scholar Cora Kaplan labelled in 2002 a \"curious\" legacy that has evolved over time: \"for an author-activist adept in many genres ... up until the last quarter-century Wollstonecraft\\'s life has been read much more closely than her writing\". After the devastating effect of Godwin\\'s Memoirs, Wollstonecraft\\'s reputation lay in tatters for nearly a century; she was pilloried by such writers as Maria Edgeworth, who patterned the \"freakish\" Harriet Freke in Belinda (1801) after her. Other novelists such as Mary Hays, Charlotte Turner Smith, Fanny Burney, and Jane West created similar figures, all to teach a \"moral lesson\" to their readers. (Hays had been a close friend, and helped nurse her in her dying days.)In contrast, there was one writer of the generation after Wollstonecraft who apparently did not share the judgmental views of her contemporaries. Jane Austen never mentioned the earlier woman by name, but several of her novels contain positive allusions to Wollstonecraft\\'s work. The American literary scholar Anne K. Mellor notes several examples. In Pride and Prejudice, Mr Wickham seems to be based upon the sort of man Wollstonecraft claimed that standing armies produce, while the sarcastic remarks of protagonist Elizabeth Bennet about \"female accomplishments\" closely echo Wollstonecraft\\'s condemnation of these activities. The balance a woman must strike between feelings and reason in Sense and Sensibility follows what Wollstonecraft recommended in her novel Mary, while the moral equivalence Austen drew in Mansfield Park between slavery and the treatment of women in British society tracks one of Wollstonecraft\\'s favorite arguments. In Persuasion, Austen\\'s characterization of Anne Eliot (as well as her late mother before her) as better qualified than her father to manage the family estate also echoes a Wollstonecraft thesis.Scholar Virginia Sapiro states that few read Wollstonecraft\\'s works during the nineteenth century as \"her attackers implied or stated that no self-respecting woman would read her work\". (Still, as Craciun points out, new editions of Rights of Woman appeared in the UK in the 1840s and in the US in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s.) If readers were few, then many were inspired; one such reader was Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who read Rights of Woman at age 12 and whose poem Aurora Leigh reflected Wollstonecraft\\'s unwavering focus on education. Lucretia Mott, a Quaker minister, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Americans who met in 1840 at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, discovered they both had read Wollstonecraft, and they agreed upon the need for (what became) the Seneca Falls Convention, an influential women\\'s rights meeting held in 1848. Another woman who read Wollstonecraft was George Eliot, a prolific writer of reviews, articles, novels, and translations. In 1855, she devoted an essay to the roles and rights of women, comparing Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller. Fuller was an American journalist, critic, and women\\'s rights activist who, like Wollstonecraft, had travelled to the Continent and had been involved in the struggle for reform (in this case the Roman Republic)—and she had a child by a man without marrying him. Wollstonecraft\\'s children\\'s tales were adapted by Charlotte Mary Yonge in 1870.Wollstonecraft\\'s work was exhumed with the rise of the movement to give women a political voice. First was an attempt at rehabilitation in 1879 with the publication of Wollstonecraft\\'s Letters to Imlay, with prefatory memoir by Charles Kegan Paul. Then followed the first full-length biography, which was by Elizabeth Robins Pennell; it appeared in 1884 as part of a series by the Roberts Brothers on famous women. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, a suffragist and later president of the National Union of Women\\'s Suffrage Societies, wrote the introduction to the centenary edition (i.e. 1892) of the Rights of Woman; it cleansed the memory of Wollstonecraft and claimed her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote. By 1898, Wollstonecraft was the subject of a first doctoral thesis and its resulting book.With the advent of the modern feminist movement, women as politically dissimilar from each other as Virginia Woolf and Emma Goldman embraced Wollstonecraft\\'s life story. By 1929 Woolf described Wollstonecraft—her writing, arguments, and \"experiments in living\"—as immortal: \"she is alive and active, she argues and experiments, we hear her voice and trace her influence even now among the living\". Others, however, continued to decry Wollstonecraft\\'s lifestyle. A biography published in 1932 refers to recent reprints of her works, incorporating new research, and to a \"study\" in 1911, a play in 1922, and another biography in 1924. Interest in her never completely died, with full-length biographies in 1937 and 1951With the emergence of feminist criticism in academia in the 1960s and 1970s, Wollstonecraft\\'s works returned to prominence. Their fortunes reflected that of the second wave of the North American feminist movement itself; for example, in the early 1970s, six major biographies of Wollstonecraft were published that presented her \"passionate life in apposition to [her] radical and rationalist agenda\". The feminist artwork The Dinner Party, first exhibited in 1979, features a place setting for Wollstonecraft. In the 1980s and 1990s, yet another image of Wollstonecraft emerged, one which described her as much more a creature of her time; scholars such as Claudia Johnson, Gary Kelly, and Virginia Sapiro demonstrated the continuity between Wollstonecraft\\'s thought and other important eighteenth-century ideas regarding topics such as sensibility, economics, and political theory.\\nWollstonecraft\\'s work has also had an effect on feminism outside the academy in recent years. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a political writer and former Muslim who is critical of Islam in general and its dictates regarding women in particular, cited the Rights of Woman in her autobiography Infidel and wrote that she was \"inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights\". British writer Caitlin Moran, author of the best-selling How to Be a Woman, described herself as \"half Wollstonecraft\" to the New Yorker. She has also inspired more widely. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, the Indian economist and philosopher who first identified the missing women of Asia, draws repeatedly on Wollstonecraft as a political philosopher in The Idea of Justice.Several plaques have been erected to honour Wollstonecraft.\\n\\n\\n== Major works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Educational works ===\\n\\nThe majority of Wollstonecraft\\'s early productions are about education; she assembled an anthology of literary extracts \"for the improvement of young women\" entitled The Female Reader and she translated two children\\'s works, Maria Geertruida van de Werken de Cambon\\'s Young Grandison and Christian Gotthilf Salzmann\\'s Elements of Morality. Her own writings also addressed the topic. In both her conduct book Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787) and her children\\'s book Original Stories from Real Life (1788), Wollstonecraft advocates educating children into the emerging middle-class ethos: self-discipline, honesty, frugality, and social contentment. Both books also emphasize the importance of teaching children to reason, revealing Wollstonecraft\\'s intellectual debt to the important seventeenth-century educational philosopher John Locke. However, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his and links it to the discourse of sensibility popular at the end of the eighteenth century. Both texts also advocate the education of women, a controversial topic at the time and one which she would return to throughout her career, most notably in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Wollstonecraft argues that well-educated women will be good wives and mothers and ultimately contribute positively to the nation.\\n\\n\\n=== Vindications ===\\n\\n\\n==== Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) ====\\n\\nPublished in response to Edmund Burke\\'s Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), which was a defence of constitutional monarchy, aristocracy, and the Church of England, and an attack on Wollstonecraft\\'s friend, the Rev Richard Price at the Newington Green Unitarian Church, Wollstonecraft\\'s A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism. Hers was the first response in a pamphlet war that subsequently became known as the Revolution Controversy, in which Thomas Paine\\'s Rights of Man (1792) became the rallying cry for reformers and radicals.\\nWollstonecraft attacked not only monarchy and hereditary privilege but also the language that Burke used to defend and elevate it. In a famous passage in the Reflections, Burke had lamented: \"I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her [Marie Antoinette] with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone.\" Most of Burke\\'s detractors deplored what they viewed as theatrical pity for the French queen—a pity they felt was at the expense of the people. Wollstonecraft was unique in her attack on Burke\\'s gendered language. By redefining the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she undermined his rhetoric as well as his argument. Burke had associated the beautiful with weakness and femininity and the sublime with strength and masculinity; Wollstonecraft turns these definitions against him, arguing that his theatrical tableaux turn Burke\\'s readers—the citizens—into weak women who are swayed by show. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia L. Johnson argues remains unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke\\'s defence of an unequal society founded on the passivity of women.\\nIn her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke\\'s system would lead to the continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke\\'s false feeling.The Rights of Men was Wollstonecraft\\'s first overtly political work, as well as her first feminist work; as Johnson contends, \"it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of Rights of Men she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career.\" It was this text that made her a well-known writer.\\n\\n\\n==== Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) ====\\n\\nA Vindication of the Rights of Woman is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society and then proceeds to redefine that position, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be \"companions\" to their husbands rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men. Large sections of the Rights of Woman respond vitriolically to conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and educational philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who wanted to deny women an education. (Rousseau famously argues in Émile (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men.)\\n\\nWollstonecraft states that currently many women are silly and superficial (she refers to them, for example, as \"spaniels\" and \"toys\"), but argues that this is not because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education. Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that women\\'s deficient educations have placed on them; she writes: \"Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman\\'s sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison.\" She implies that, without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, women could achieve much more.While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: \"Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.\" Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word did not come into existence until the 1890s.One of Wollstonecraft\\'s most scathing critiques in the Rights of Woman is of false and excessive sensibility, particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are \"blown about by every momentary gust of feeling\" and because they are \"the prey of their senses\" they cannot think rationally. In fact, she claims, they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilization: these are not women who can help refine a civilization—a popular eighteenth-century idea—but women who will destroy it. Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other; rather, she believes that they should inform each other.In addition to her larger philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft also lays out a specific educational plan. In the twelfth chapter of the Rights of Woman, \"On National Education\", she argues that all children should be sent to a \"country day school\" as well as given some education at home \"to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures.\" She also maintains that schooling should be co-educational, arguing that men and women, whose marriages are \"the cement of society\", should be \"educated after the same model.\"Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle-class, which she describes as the \"most natural state\", and in many ways the Rights of Woman is inflected by a bourgeois view of the world. It encourages modesty and industry in its readers and attacks the uselessness of the aristocracy. But Wollstonecraft is not necessarily a friend to the poor; for example, in her national plan for education, she suggests that, after the age of nine, the poor, except for those who are brilliant, should be separated from the rich and taught in another school.\\n\\n\\n=== Novels ===\\n\\nBoth of Wollstonecraft\\'s novels criticize what she viewed as the patriarchal institution of marriage and its deleterious effects on women. In her first novel, Mary: A Fiction (1788), the eponymous heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons; she fulfils her desire for love and affection outside of marriage with two passionate romantic friendships, one with a woman and one with a man. Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman (1798), an unfinished novel published posthumously and often considered Wollstonecraft\\'s most radical feminist work, revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband; like Mary, Maria also finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate and a friendship with one of her keepers. Neither of Wollstonecraft\\'s novels depict successful marriages, although she posits such relationships in the Rights of Woman. At the end of Mary, the heroine believes she is going \"to that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage\", presumably a positive state of affairs.Both of Wollstonecraft\\'s novels also critique the discourse of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end of the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine\\'s indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.Female friendships are central to both of Wollstonecraft\\'s novels, but it is the friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman is one of the first moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.\\n\\n\\n=== Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796) ===\\n\\nWollstonecraft\\'s Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is a deeply personal travel narrative. The twenty-five letters cover a wide range of topics, from sociological reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity to musings on her relationship with Imlay (although he is not referred to by name in the text). Using the rhetoric of the sublime, Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between the self and society. Reflecting the strong influence of Rousseau, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark shares the themes of the French philosopher\\'s Reveries of a Solitary Walker (1782): \"the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding\". While Rousseau ultimately rejects society, however, Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text.\\n\\nWollstonecraft promotes subjective experience, particularly in relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and sensibility. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft\\'s desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works. As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to the world with a commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was Wollstonecraft\\'s most popular book in the 1790s. It sold well and was reviewed positively by most critics. Godwin wrote \"if ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book.\" It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who drew on its themes and its aesthetic.\\n\\n\\n== List of works ==\\nThis is a complete list of Mary Wollstonecraft\\'s works; all works are the first edition unless otherwise noted.\\n\\n\\n=== Authored by Wollstonecraft ===\\nThoughts on the Education of Daughters: With Reflections on Female Conduct, in the More Important Duties of Life.

       " {'Title': 'Percy Bysshe Shelley',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'Percy Bysshe Shelley ( (listen) BISH; 4 August 1792 – 8 July 1822) was one of the major English Romantic poets, widely regarded as one of the finest lyric and philosophical poets in the English language. A radical in his poetry as well as in his political and social views, Shelley did not see fame during his lifetime, but recognition of his achievements in poetry grew steadily following his death. Shelley became a key member of a close circle of visionary poets and writers that included Lord Byron, John Keats, Leigh Hunt, Thomas Love Peacock and his own second wife, Mary Shelley (the author of Frankenstein).\\nShelley is perhaps best known for classic poems such as \"Ozymandias\", \"Ode to the West Wind\", \"To a Skylark\", \"Music, When Soft Voices Die\", \"The Cloud\" and The Masque of Anarchy. His other major works include a groundbreaking verse drama, The Cenci (1819), and long, visionary, philosophical poems such as Queen Mab (later reworked as The Daemon of the World), Alastor, The Revolt of Islam, Adonais, Prometheus Unbound (1820)—widely considered his masterpiece, Hellas: A Lyrical Drama (1821) and his final, unfinished work, The Triumph of Life (1822).\\nShelley\\'s close circle of friends included some of the most important progressive/radical thinkers of his day, including his father-in-law, the philosopher William Godwin (1756–1836), and Leigh Hunt (1784–1859). Though Shelley\\'s poetry and prose output remained steady throughout his life, most publishers and journals declined to publish his work for fear of being arrested for either blasphemy or sedition. Shelley\\'s poetry sometimes had only an underground readership during his day, but his poetic achievements have become widely recognized today, and his political and social thought had an impact on the Chartist and other movements in England, and reach down to the present day. Shelley\\'s theories of economics and morality, for example, had a profound influence on Karl Marx (1818–1883); his early—perhaps first—writings on nonviolent resistance influenced Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910), whose writings on the subject in turn influenced Mahatma Gandhi, and through him Martin Luther King Jr. and others practicing nonviolence during the American civil rights movement.\\nShelley became a lodestar to the subsequent three or four generations of poets, including important Victorian and Pre-Raphaelite poets such as Robert Browning (1812–1889) and Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882). Admirers have included Oscar Wilde, Thomas Hardy, George Bernard Shaw, Leo Tolstoy, Bertrand Russell, W. B. Yeats, Upton Sinclair and Isadora Duncan. Henry David Thoreau\\'s Civil Disobedience (1849) apparently shows the influence of Shelley\\'s writings and theories on nonviolence in protest and political action. Shelley\\'s popularity and influence has continued to grow in contemporary poetry circles.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and education ===\\nShelley was born on 4 August 1792 at Field Place, Broadbridge Heath, near Horsham, West Sussex, England. He was the eldest son of Sir Timothy Shelley (1753–1844), a Whig Member of Parliament for Horsham from 1790 to 1792 and for Shoreham between 1806 and 1812, and his wife, Elizabeth Pilfold (1763–1846), a Sussex landowner. He had four younger sisters and one much younger brother. He received his early education at home, tutored by the cleric Evan Edwards of nearby Warnham. His cousin and lifelong friend Thomas Medwin, who lived nearby, recounted his early childhood in his The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was a happy and contented childhood spent largely in country pursuits such as fishing and hunting.In 1802 he entered the Syon House Academy of Brentford, Middlesex. In 1804, Shelley entered Eton College, where he fared poorly and was subjected to an almost daily mob torment at around noon by older boys, who aptly called these incidents \"Shelley-baits\". Surrounded, the young Shelley would have his books torn from his hands and his clothes pulled at and torn until he cried out madly in his high-pitched \"cracked soprano\" of a voice. This daily misery could be attributed to Shelley\\'s refusal to take part in fagging and his indifference towards games and other youthful activities. Because of these peculiarities, he acquired the nickname \"Mad Shelley\". Shelley possessed a keen interest in science at Eton, which he would often apply to cause a surprising amount of mischief for a boy considered to be so sensible. Shelley would often use a frictional electric machine to charge the door handle of his room, much to the amusement of his friends. His friends were particularly amused when his gentlemanly tutor, Mr Bethell, in attempting to enter his room, was alarmed at the noise of the electric shocks, despite Shelley\\'s dutiful protestations. His mischievous side was again demonstrated by \"his last bit of naughtiness at school\", which was to blow up a tree on Eton\\'s South Meadow with gunpowder. Despite these jocular incidents, a contemporary of Shelley, W. H. Marie, recalled that Shelley made no friends at Eton, although he did seek a kindred spirit without success.\\nOn 10 April 1810 he matriculated at University College, Oxford. It is widely believed that Shelley attended only one lecture while at Oxford, but frequently read sixteen hours a day. His first publication was a Gothic novel, Zastrozzi (1810), in which he vented his early atheistic worldview through the villain Zastrozzi; this was followed at the end of the year by St. Irvine; or, The Rosicrucian: A Romance (dated 1811). In the same year, Shelley, together with his sister Elizabeth, published Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire and, while at Oxford, he issued a collection of verses (ostensibly burlesque but quite subversive), Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson, with Thomas Jefferson Hogg.\\nIn 1811 Shelley anonymously published a pamphlet called \"The Necessity of Atheism\", which was brought to the attention of the university administration, and he was called to appear before the college\\'s fellows, including the Dean, George Rowley. His refusal, to college authorities, to answer questions regarding whether or not he authored the pamphlet resulted in his expulsion from Oxford on 25 March 1811, along with Hogg. The rediscovery in mid-2006 of Shelley\\'s long-lost \"Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things\"—a long, strident anti-monarchical and anti-war poem printed in 1811 in London by Crosby and Company as \"by a gentleman of the University of Oxford\" and dedicated to Harriet Westbrook—gives a new dimension to the expulsion, reinforcing Hogg\\'s implication of political motives (\"an affair of party\"). Shelley was given the choice to be reinstated after his father intervened, on the condition that he would have to recant his avowed views. His refusal to do so led to a falling-out with his father.\\n\\n\\n=== Marriage ===\\nFour months after being sent down from Oxford, on 28 August 1811, the 19-year-old Shelley eloped to Scotland with the 16-year-old Harriet Westbrook, a pupil at the same boarding school as Shelley\\'s sisters, whom his father had forbidden him to see. Harriet Westbrook had been writing Shelley passionate letters threatening to kill herself because of her unhappiness at the school and at home. Shelley, heartbroken after the failure of his romance with his cousin, Harriet Grove, cut off from his mother and sisters, and convinced he had not long to live, impulsively decided to rescue Westbrook and make her his beneficiary. Westbrook\\'s 28-year-old sister Eliza, to whom Harriet was very close, appears to have encouraged the young girl\\'s infatuation with the future baronet. The Westbrooks pretended to disapprove but secretly encouraged the elopement. Sir Timothy Shelley, however, outraged that his son had married beneath him (Harriet\\'s father, though prosperous, had kept a tavern), revoked Shelley\\'s allowance and refused ever to receive the couple at Field Place. Harriet also insisted that her sister Eliza, whom Shelley detested, live with them. Shelley invited his friend Hogg to share his ménage but asked him to leave when Hogg made advances to Harriet. Shelley was also at this time increasingly involved in an intense platonic relationship with Elizabeth Hitchener, a 28-year-old unmarried schoolteacher of advanced views, with whom he had been corresponding. Hitchener, whom Shelley called the \"sister of my soul\" and \"my second self\", became his muse and confidante in the writing of his philosophical poem Queen Mab, a Utopian allegory.\\n\\nDuring this period, Shelley travelled to Keswick in England\\'s Lake District, where he visited the poet Robert Southey, under the mistaken impression that Southey was still a political radical. Southey, who had himself been expelled from the Westminster School for opposing flogging, was taken with Shelley and predicted great things for him as a poet. He also informed Shelley that William Godwin, author of Political Justice, which had greatly influenced him in his youth, and which Shelley also admired, was still alive. Shelley wrote to Godwin, offering himself as his devoted disciple and informing Godwin that he was \"the son of a man of fortune in Sussex\" and \"heir by entail to an estate of £6,000.\" Godwin, who supported a large family and was chronically penniless, immediately saw in Shelley a source of his financial salvation. He wrote asking for more particulars about Shelley\\'s income and began advising him to reconcile with Sir Timothy. Meanwhile, Sir Timothy\\'s patron, the Duke of Norfolk, a former Catholic who favoured Catholic emancipation, was also vainly trying to reconcile Sir Timothy and his son, whose political career the Duke wished to encourage. A maternal uncle ultimately supplied money to pay Shelley\\'s debts, but Shelley\\'s relationship with the Duke may have influenced his decision to travel to Ireland. In Dublin, Shelley published his Address to the Irish People, priced at five pence, \"the lowest possible price\" to \"awaken in the minds of the Irish poor a knowledge of their real state, summarily pointing out the evils of that state and suggesting a rational means of remedy—Catholic Emancipation and a repeal of the Union Act\" (the latter \"the most successful engine that England ever wielded over the misery of fallen Ireland\"). His activities earned him the unfavourable attention of the British government.\\nShelley was increasingly unhappy in his marriage to Harriet and particularly resented the influence of her older sister Eliza, who discouraged Harriet from breastfeeding their baby daughter (Ianthe Elizabeth Shelley [1813–1876]). Shelley accused Harriet of having married him for his money. Craving more intellectual female companionship, he began spending more time away from home, among other things, studying Italian with Cornelia Turner and visiting the home and bookshop of William Godwin. Eliza and Harriet moved back with their parents.\\n\\nShelley\\'s mentor Godwin had three highly educated daughters, two of whom, Fanny Imlay and Claire Clairmont, were his adopted step-daughters. Godwin\\'s first wife, the celebrated feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, had died shortly after giving birth to Godwin\\'s biological daughter Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, named after her mother. Fanny was the illegitimate daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft and her lover, the diplomat speculator and writer, Gilbert Imlay. Claire was the illegitimate daughter of Godwin\\'s second wife, Mary Jane Clairmont Godwin (c.\\u20091766–1841), whom Shelley considered a vulgar woman—\"not a proper person to form the mind of a young girl\", he is supposed to have said—and Sir John Lethbridge. The brilliant Mary was being educated in Scotland when Shelley first became acquainted with the Godwin family. When she returned, Shelley fell madly in love with her, repeatedly threatening to commit suicide if she did not return his affections.\\n\\nOn 28 July 1814 Shelley abandoned Harriet, now pregnant with their son Charles (November 1814 – 1826) and (in imitation of the hero of one of Godwin\\'s novels) he ran away to Switzerland with Mary, then 16, inviting her stepsister Claire Clairmont (also 16) along because she could speak French. The older sister Fanny was left behind, to her great dismay, for she, too, may have fallen in love with Shelley. The three sailed to Europe, and made their way across France to Switzerland on foot, reading aloud from the works of Rousseau, Shakespeare, and Mary\\'s mother, Mary Wollstonecraft (an account of their travels was subsequently published by the Shelleys). \\nAfter six weeks, homesick and destitute, the three young people returned to England. The enraged William Godwin refused to see them, though he still demanded money, to be given to him under another name, to avoid scandal. In late 1815, while living in a cottage in Bishopsgate, Surrey, with Mary and avoiding creditors, Shelley wrote Alastor, or The Spirit of Solitude. It attracted little attention at the time, but has now come to be recognised as his first major achievement. At this point in his writing career, Shelley was deeply influenced by the poetry of Wordsworth.\\n\\n\\n=== Byron ===\\nIn mid-1816 Shelley and Mary made a second trip to Switzerland. They were prompted to do this by Mary\\'s stepsister Claire Clairmont, who, in competition with her sister, had initiated a liaison with Lord Byron the previous April just before his self-exile on the continent. Byron\\'s interest in her had waned, and Claire used the opportunity of introducing him to Mary and Shelley to act as bait to lure him to Geneva. The couple and Byron rented neighbouring houses on the shores of Lake Geneva. Regular conversation with Byron had an invigorating effect on Shelley\\'s output of poetry. While on a boating tour the two took together, Shelley was inspired to write his Hymn to Intellectual Beauty, often considered his first significant production since Alastor. A tour of Chamonix in the French Alps inspired Mont Blanc, a poem in which Shelley claims to have pondered questions of historical inevitability (determinism) and the relationship between the human mind and external nature. Shelley also encouraged Byron to begin an epic poem on a contemporary subject, advice that resulted in Byron\\'s composition of Don Juan. In 1817 Claire gave birth to a daughter by Byron, Alba, later renamed Allegra, whom Shelley offered to support, making provisions for her and for Claire in his will.\\n\\n\\n=== Second marriage ===\\nAfter Shelley and Mary\\'s return to England, Fanny Imlay, Mary\\'s half-sister and Claire\\'s stepsister, despondent over her exclusion from the Shelley household and perhaps unhappy at being omitted from Shelley\\'s will, travelled from Godwin\\'s household in London to kill herself in Wales in early October. On 10 December 1816 the body of Shelley\\'s estranged wife Harriet was found in an advanced state of pregnancy, drowned in the Serpentine in Hyde Park, London. Shelley had made generous provision for Harriet and their children in his will and had paid her a monthly allowance as had her father. Many years later, in 1875, Claire Clairmont claimed to Edward John Trelawny, a biographer of Shelley, that just before her death Harriet left her children with her sister Elizabeth, and believed herself to have been abandoned by a new lover, 36-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Maxwell, who had been deployed abroad, after a landlady refused to forward his letters to her. However, Shelley himself never alluded to Harriet\\'s alleged affair with Maxwell, and he offered no proof to the courts during his custody battle with Harriet\\'s family that Harriet had been unfaithful to him with anyone, even though rumors about Harriet\\'s alleged other lovers had been promoted by William Godwin and others, and even though such a claim would have helped his case. On 30 December 1816, barely three weeks after Harriet\\'s body was recovered, Shelley and Mary Godwin were married. The marriage was intended partly to help secure Shelley\\'s custody of his children by Harriet and partly to placate Godwin, who had coldly refused to speak to his daughter for two years, and who now received the couple. The courts, however, awarded custody of Shelley and Harriet\\'s children to foster parents, on the grounds that Shelley had abandoned his first wife for Mary without cause and was an atheist.The Shelleys took up residence in the village of Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where a friend of Percy\\'s, Thomas Love Peacock, lived. Shelley took part in the literary circle that surrounded Leigh Hunt, and during this period he met John Keats. Shelley\\'s major production during this time was Laon and Cythna; or, The Revolution of the Golden City, a long narrative poem in which he attacked religion and featured a pair of incestuous lovers. It was hastily withdrawn after only a few copies were published. It was later edited and reissued as The Revolt of Islam in 1818. Shelley wrote two revolutionary political tracts under the nom de plume \"The Hermit of Marlow\". On Boxing Day 1817, presumably prompted by travellers\\' reports of Giovanni Battista Belzoni\\'s success (where the French had failed) in removing the \"half sunk and shattered visage\" of the so-called \"Young Memnon\" from the Ramesseum at Thebes, Shelley and his friend Horace Smith began a poem each about the Memnon or \"Ozymandias\", Diodorus\\'s \"King of Kings\", who in an inscription on the base of his statue challenged all comers to \"surpass my works\". Within four months of the publication of Ozymandias (or Rameses II), his seven-and-a-quarter-ton bust arrived in London, just too late for Shelley to have seen it.\\n\\n\\n=== Italy ===\\n\\nOn 11 March 1818 the Shelleys and Claire left England to take Claire\\'s daughter, Allegra, to her father Byron, who had taken up residence in Venice. Two days before they left, William, Clara and Allegra were all baptised at the church of St Giles in the Fields. Contact with the older and more established poet encouraged Shelley to write once again. During the latter part of the year, he wrote Julian and Maddalo, a lightly disguised rendering of his boat trips and conversations with Byron in Venice, finishing with a visit to a madhouse. This poem marked the appearance of Shelley\\'s \"urbane style\". He then began the long verse drama Prometheus Unbound, a re-writing of the lost play by the ancient Greek poet Aeschylus, which features talking mountains and a petulant spirit who overthrows Jupiter. Tragedy struck, however, first in 1818 when Shelley\\'s infant daughter Clara Everina died during yet another household move, and then in 1819 when his son Will died of fever (most likely malaria) in Rome.\\nA baby girl, Elena Adelaide Shelley, was born on 27 December 1818 in Naples, Italy, and registered there as the daughter of Shelley and a woman named \"Marina Padurin\". However, the identity of the mother is an unsolved mystery. Some scholars speculate that her true mother was actually Claire Clairmont or Elise Foggi, a nursemaid for the Shelley family. Other scholars postulate that she was a foundling Shelley adopted in hopes of distracting Mary after the death of Clara. Shelley referred to Elena in letters as his \"Neapolitan ward\". However, Elena was placed with foster parents a few days after her birth and the Shelley family moved on to yet another Italian city, leaving her behind. Elena died 17 months later, on 10 June 1820.\\n\\nThe Shelleys moved between various Italian cities during these years; in later 1818 they were living in Florence, in a pensione on the Via Valfonda. This street now runs alongside Florence\\'s railway station, and the building now on the site, the original having been destroyed in World War II, carries a plaque recording the poet\\'s stay. Here they received two visitors, a Sophia Stacey and her much older travelling companion, Corbet Parry-Jones (to be described by Mary as \"an ignorant little Welshwoman\"). Sophia had for three years in her youth been ward of the poet\\'s aunt and uncle. The pair moved into the same pensione and stayed for about two months. During this period Mary gave birth to another son; Sophia is credited with suggesting that he be named after the city of his birth, so he became Percy Florence Shelley, later Sir Percy. Shelley also wrote his \"Ode to Sophia Stacey\" during this time. They then moved to Pisa, largely at the suggestion of its resident Margaret King, who, as a former pupil of Mary Wollstonecraft, took a maternal interest in the younger Mary and her companions. This \"no nonsense grande dame\" and her common-law husband George William Tighe inspired the poet with \"a new-found sense of radicalism\". Tighe was an agricultural theorist, and provided the younger man with a great deal of material on chemistry, biology and statistics.Shelley completed Prometheus Unbound in Rome, and he spent mid-1819 writing a tragedy, The Cenci, in Leghorn (Livorno). In this year, prompted among other causes by the Peterloo Massacre, he wrote his best-known political poems: The Masque of Anarchy and Men of England. These were probably his best-remembered works during the 19th century. Around this time period, he wrote the essay The Philosophical View of Reform, which was his most thorough exposition of his political views to that date.\\nIn 1820, hearing of John Keats\\'s illness from a friend, Shelley wrote him a letter inviting him to join him at his residence at Pisa. Keats replied with hopes of seeing him, but instead, arrangements were made for Keats to travel to Rome with the artist Joseph Severn. Inspired by the death of Keats, in 1821 Shelley wrote the elegy Adonais.\\nIn 1821 Shelley met Edward Ellerker Williams, a British naval officer, and his wife Jane Williams. Shelley developed a very strong affection towards Jane and addressed a number of poems to her. In the poems addressed to Jane, such as With a Guitar, To Jane and One Word is Too Often Profaned, he elevates her to an exalted position worthy of worship.\\nIn 1822 Shelley arranged for Leigh Hunt, the British poet and editor who had been one of his chief supporters in England, to come to Italy with his family. He meant for the three of them—himself, Byron and Hunt—to create a journal, which would be called The Liberal. With Hunt as editor, their controversial writings would be disseminated, and the journal would act as a counter-blast to conservative periodicals such as Blackwood\\'s Magazine and Quarterly Review.\\n\\nLeigh Hunt\\'s son, the editor Thornton Leigh Hunt, was later asked by John Bedford Leno whether he preferred Shelley or Byron as a man. He replied:On one occasion I had to fetch or take to Byron some copy for the paper which my father, himself and Shelley, jointly conducted. I found him seated on a lounge feasting himself from a drum of figs. He asked me if I would like a fig. Now, in that, Leno, consists the difference, Shelley would have handed me the drum and allowed me to help myself.\\n\\n\\n=== Death ===\\nOn 8 July 1822, less than a month before his 30th birthday, Shelley drowned in a sudden storm on the Gulf of La Spezia while returning from Leghorn (Livorno) to Lerici in his sailing boat, the Don Juan. He was returning from having set up The Liberal with the newly arrived Leigh Hunt. The name Don Juan, a compliment to Byron, was chosen by Edward John Trelawny, a member of the Shelley–Byron Pisan circle. However, according to Mary Shelley\\'s testimony, Shelley changed it to Ariel, which annoyed Byron, who forced the painting of the words \"Don Juan\" on the mainsail. The vessel, an open boat, was custom-built in Genoa for Shelley. It did not capsize but sank; Mary Shelley declared in her \"Note on Poems of 1822\" (1839) that the design had a defect and that the boat was never seaworthy. In fact the Don Juan was overmasted; the sinking was due to a severe storm and poor seamanship of the three men on board.Some believed his death was not accidental, that Shelley was depressed and wanted to die; others suggested he simply did not know how to navigate. More fantastical theories, including the possibility of pirates mistaking the boat for Byron\\'s, also circulated. There is a small amount of material, though scattered and contradictory, suggesting that Shelley may have been murdered for political reasons: previously, at Plas Tan-Yr-Allt, the Regency house he rented at Tremadog, near Porthmadog, north-west Wales, from 1812 to 1813, he had allegedly been surprised and attacked during the night by a man who may have been, according to some later writers, an intelligence agent. Shelley, who was in financial difficulty, left forthwith leaving rent unpaid and without contributing to the fund to support the house owner, William Madocks; this may provide another, more plausible explanation for this story.\\n\\nTwo other Englishmen were with Shelley on the boat. One was a retired naval officer, Edward Ellerker Williams; the other was a boatboy, Charles Vivien. The boat was found ten miles (16 km) offshore, and it was suggested that one side of the boat had been rammed and staved in by a much stronger vessel. However, the liferaft was unused and still attached to the boat. The bodies were found completely clothed, including boots.\\nIn his Recollections of the Last Days of Shelley and Byron, Trelawny noted that the shirt in which Williams\\'s body was clad was \"partly drawn over the head, as if the wearer had been in the act of taking it off [...] and [he was missing] one boot, indicating also that he had attempted to strip.\" Trelawny also relates a supposed deathbed confession by an Italian fisherman who claimed to have rammed Shelley\\'s boat to rob him, a plan confounded by the rapid sinking of the vessel.\\n\\nShelley\\'s body was washed ashore and later, in keeping with quarantine regulations, was cremated on the beach near Viareggio. In Shelley\\'s pocket was a small book of Keats\\' poetry. Upon hearing this, Byron (never one to give compliments) said of Shelley: \"I never met a man who wasn\\'t a beast in comparison to him.\" The day after the news of his death reached England, the Tory newspaper The Courier printed: \"Shelley, the writer of some infidel poetry, has been drowned; now he knows whether there is God or no.\" A reclining statue of Shelley\\'s body, depicted as washed up on the shore, created by sculptor Edward Onslow Ford at the behest of Shelley\\'s daughter-in-law, Jane, Lady Shelley, is the centrepiece of the Shelley Memorial at University College, Oxford. An 1889 painting by Louis Édouard Fournier, The Funeral of Shelley (also known as The Cremation of Shelley), contains inaccuracies. In pre-Victorian times it was English custom that women would not attend funerals for health reasons. Mary Shelley did not attend but was featured in the painting, kneeling at the left-hand side. Leigh Hunt stayed in the carriage during the ceremony but is also pictured. Also, Trelawny, in his account of the recovery of Shelley\\'s body, records that \"the face and hands, and parts of the body not protected by the dress, were fleshless,\" and by the time that the party returned to the beach for the cremation, the body was even further decomposed. In his graphic account of the cremation, he writes of Byron being unable to face the scene, and withdrawing to the beach.\\n\\nShelley\\'s ashes were interred in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome, near an ancient pyramid in the city walls. His grave bears the Latin inscription, Cor Cordium (Heart of Hearts), and, in reference to his death at sea, a few lines of \"Ariel\\'s Song\" from Shakespeare\\'s The Tempest: \"Nothing of him that doth fade / But doth suffer a sea-change / Into something rich and strange.\" The grave site is the second in the cemetery. Some weeks after Shelley\\'s ashes had been buried, Trelawny had come to Rome, had not liked his friend\\'s position among a number of other graves, and had purchased what seemed to him a better plot near the old wall. The ashes were exhumed and moved to their present location. Trelawny had purchased the adjacent plot, and over 60 years later his remains were placed there.\\nA memorial was eventually created for Shelley at the Poets\\' Corner at Westminster Abbey, along with his old friends Lord Byron and John Keats.\\n\\n\\n== Shelley\\'s heart ==\\nShelley\\'s widow Mary bought a cliff-top home at Boscombe, Bournemouth, in 1851. She intended to live there with her son, Percy, and his wife Jane, and had the remains of her own parents moved from their London burial place at St Pancras Old Church to an underground mausoleum in the town. The property is now known as Shelley Manor. When Lady Jane Shelley was to be buried in the family vault, it was discovered that in her copy of Adonais was an envelope containing ashes, which she had identified as belonging to her father-in-law. The family had preserved the story that when Shelley\\'s body had been burned, his friend Edward Trelawny had snatched the whole heart from the pyre. These same accounts say that the heart had been buried with Shelley\\'s son, Percy. All accounts agree, however, that the remains now lie in the vault in the churchyard of St Peter\\'s Church, Bournemouth.\\nFor several years in the 20th century some of Trelawny\\'s collection of Shelley ephemera, including a painting of Shelley as a child, a jacket, and a lock of his hair, were on display in \"The Shelley Rooms\", a small museum at Shelley Manor. When the museum finally closed in 2001, these items were returned to Lord Abinger, who descends from a niece of Lady Jane Shelley.\\n\\n\\n== Family history ==\\n\\n\\n=== Ancestry ===\\nHenry Shelley became father to younger Henry Shelley. This younger Henry had at least three sons. The youngest of them, Richard Shelley was born in 1583, and baptized 17 November 1583 in Warminghurst, Sussex, England. Richard later married on 3 February 1601 in Itchingfield to Jonne (aka Joane) Feste/Feest/Fuste, daughter of John Feest/Fuste from Itchingfield, near Horsham, West Sussex. Their grandson, John Shelley of Fen Place, Turners Hill, West Sussex, was married himself to Helen Bysshe, daughter of Roger Bysshe. Their son Timothy Shelley of Fen Place (born c. 1700) married widow Johanna Plum from New York City. Timothy and Johanna were the great-grandparents of Percy.\\n\\n\\n==== Ancestry chart ====\\n\\n\\n=== Family ===\\nShelley was born to Sir Timothy Shelley (1753–1844) and his wife Elizabeth Pilfold following their marriage in October 1791. His father was son and heir to Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet of Castle Goring (1731–1815) by his wife Mary Catherine Michell (d. 1760). His mother was daughter of Charles Pilfold of Effingham. Through his paternal grandmother, Shelley was a great-grandson to Reverend Theobald Michell of Horsham. Through his maternal and paternal lineage, he was a cousin of Thomas Medwin—a childhood friend and Shelley\\'s biographer.Shelley was the eldest of six children. His younger siblings were:\\n\\nJohn Shelley of Avington House (1806–1866; m.1827 Elizabeth Bowen (d. 1889));\\nMary Shelley (NB. not to be confused with his wife);\\nElizabeth Shelley (d. 1831);\\nHellen Shelley (d. 1885);\\nMargaret Shelley (d. 1887).Shelley\\'s uncle, brother of his mother Elizabeth Pilfold, was Captain John Pilfold, a Naval Commander who served under Admiral Nelson during the Battle of Trafalgar.\\n\\n\\n=== Descendants ===\\nThree children survived Shelley: Ianthe and Charles, his daughter and son by Harriet; and Percy Florence Shelley, his son by Mary. Charles, who suffered from tuberculosis, died in 1826 after being struck by lightning during a rainstorm. Percy Florence, who eventually inherited the baronetcy in 1844, died without children \"of his body\", as the old legal phrase went.\\nSeveral members of the Scarlett family were born at Percy Florence\\'s seaside home \"Boscombe Manor\" in Bournemouth. They were descendants of Percy Florence\\'s and Jane Gibson\\'s adopted daughter, Bessie Florence Gibson. The 1891 census shows Jane Shelley, Percy Florence Shelley\\'s widow, living at Boscombe Manor with several great-nephews. Percy Florence Shelley died in 1889, and his widow, the former Jane St. John (born Gibson), died in 1899.\\nThe only lineal descendants of the poet are therefore the children of Ianthe. Ianthe Eliza Shelley was married in 1837 to Edward Jeffries Esdaile of Cothelstone Manor, grandson of the banker William Esdaile of Lombard Street, London. The marriage resulted in the birth of three daughters, Ianthe Harriet Shelley (1839–1849), Eliza Margaret (1841–1930), and Mary Emily Sydney (1848–1854), and three sons, Charles Edward (1842–1842), Charles Edward Jeffries (1845–1922), and William (1846–1915). Ianthe died in 1876, and her only descendants result from the marriage of Charles Edward Jeffries Esdaile and Marion Maxwell Sandbach.\\nMike Rutherford, bass player/guitarist of progressive rock band Genesis, is a descendant of Shelley\\'s maternal aunt.\\n\\n\\n== Idealism ==\\nShelley\\'s unconventional life and uncompromising idealism, combined with his strong disapproving voice, made him an authoritative and much-denigrated figure during his life and afterward. He became an idol of the next two or three or even four generations of poets, including the important Victorian and Pre-Raphaelite poets Robert Browning, Alfred Tennyson, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne, as well as Lord Byron, Henry David Thoreau, W. B. Yeats, Aleister Crowley and Edna St. Vincent Millay, and poets in other languages such as Jan Kasprowicz, Rabindranath Tagore, Jibanananda Das and Subramanya Bharathy.\\n\\n\\n=== Nonviolence ===\\nHenry David Thoreau\\'s Civil Disobedience, the writings of Leo Tolstoy, and Mahatma Gandhi\\'s passive resistance were all influenced and inspired by Shelley\\'s theories of nonviolent resistance, in protest and political action. It is known that Gandhi would often quote Shelley\\'s The Masque of Anarchy, which has been called \"perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent resistance\".\\n\\n\\n=== Vegetarianism ===\\nShelley wrote several essays on the subject of vegetarianism, the more prominent of which were \"A Vindication of Natural Diet\" (1813) and \"On the Vegetable System of Diet\". Shelley\\'s eagerness for vegetarianism is connected with India. In 1812 he was converted to vegetarianism by his friend John Frank Newton, who had himself been converted while living in India.\\nShelley, in heartfelt dedication to sentient beings, wrote:If the use of animal food be, in consequence, subversive to the peace of human society, how unwarrantable is the injustice and the barbarity which is exercised toward these miserable victims. They are called into existence by human artifice that they may drag out a short and miserable existence of slavery and disease, that their bodies may be mutilated, their social feelings outraged. It were much better that a sentient being should never have existed, than that it should have existed only to endure unmitigated misery\"; \"Never again may blood of bird or beast/ Stain with its venomous stream a human feast,/ To the pure skies in accusation steaming\"; and \"It is only by softening and disguising dead flesh by culinary preparation that it is rendered susceptible of mastication or digestion, and that the sight of its bloody juices and raw horror does not excite intolerable loathing and disgust. In Queen Mab: A Philosophical Poem (1813) he wrote about the change to a vegetarian diet: \"And man ... no longer now/ He slays the lamb that looks him in the face,/ And horribly devours his mangled flesh.\"\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\nShelley\\'s mainstream following did not develop until a generation after his death, unlike Lord Byron, who was popular among all classes during his lifetime despite his radical views. For decades after his death, Shelley was mainly appreciated by only the major Victorian poets, the pre-Raphaelites, the socialists, and the labour movement. One reason for this was the extreme discomfort with Shelley\\'s political radicalism, which led popular anthologists to confine Shelley\\'s reputation to the relatively sanitised \"magazine\" pieces such as \"Ozymandias\" or \"Lines to an Indian Air\".\\nHe was admired by C. S. Lewis, Karl Marx, Robert Browning, Henry Stephens Salt, Gregory Corso, George Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell, Isadora Duncan, Constance Naden, Upton Sinclair, Gabriele d\\'Annunzio, Aleister Crowley, and W. B. Yeats. Shelley had an enduring and profound influence on the Dutch poets of \"De nieuwe Gids\" (Kloos, Van Eeden e.a.). Samuel Barber, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Roger Quilter, Howard Skempton, John Vanderslice, and Ralph Vaughan Williams composed music based on his poems.\\nCritics such as Matthew Arnold endeavoured to rewrite Shelley\\'s legacy to make him seem a lyricist and a dilettante who had no serious intellectual position and whose longer poems were not worthy of study. Arnold famously described Shelley as a \"beautiful and ineffectual angel\". This position contrasted strongly with the judgement of the previous generation who knew Shelley as a sceptic and a radical.\\nMany of Shelley\\'s works remained unpublished or little known after his death, with longer pieces such as A Philosophical View of Reform existing only in manuscript until the 1920s. This contributed to the Victorian idea of him as a minor lyricist. With the inception of formal literary studies in the early twentieth century and the slow rediscovery and re-evaluation of his œuvre by scholars such as Kenneth Neill Cameron, Donald H. Reiman, and Harold Bloom, the modern idea of Shelley could not be more different.\\nPaul Foot, in his Red Shelley, has documented the pivotal role Shelley\\'s works—especially Queen Mab—have played in the genesis of British radicalism. Although Shelley\\'s works were banned from respectable Victorian households, his political writings were pirated by men such as Richard Carlile who regularly went to jail for printing \"seditious and blasphemous libel\" (i.e. material proscribed by the government), and these cheap pirate editions reached hundreds of activists and workers throughout the nineteenth century.Shelley\\'s poem \"To the Queen of My Heart\" was allegedly forged and falsely attributed to Shelley by James Augustus St. John, who took over as editor of the London Weekly Review when Carlile was imprisoned in 1827.In other countries, such as India, Shelley\\'s works both in the original and in translation have influenced poets such as Rabindranath Tagore and Jibanananda Das. A pirated copy of Prometheus Unbound dated 1835 is said to have been seized in that year by customs at Bombay.\\nPaul Johnson, in his book Intellectuals, describes Shelley in a chapter titled \"Shelley or the Heartlessness of Ideas\". In the book, Johnson describes Shelley as an amoral person, who by borrowing money which he did not intend to return, and by seducing young innocent women who fell for him, destroyed the lives of everybody with whom he had interacted, including his own.\\nIn 2005 the University of Delaware Press published an extensive two-volume biography by James Bieri. In 2008 the Johns Hopkins University Press published Bieri\\'s 856-page one-volume biography, Percy Bysshe Shelley: A Biography.\\nThe rediscovery in mid-2006 of Shelley\\'s long-lost \"Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things\", as noted above, was slow to be followed up until the only known surviving copy was acquired by the Bodleian Library in Oxford as its 12-millionth book in November 2015 and made available online. An analysis of the poem by the only person known to have examined the whole work at the time of the original discovery appeared in the Times Literary Supplement: H.R. Woudhuysen, \"Shelley\\'s Fantastic Prank\", 12 July 2006.In 2007 John Lauritsen published The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein, in which he argued that Percy Bysshe Shelley\\'s contributions to the novel were much more extensive than had previously been assumed. It has been known and not disputed that Shelley wrote the Preface—although uncredited—and that he contributed at least 4,000–5,000 words to the novel. Lauritsen sought to show that Shelley was the primary author of the novel.\\nIn 2008 Percy Bysshe Shelley was credited as the co-author of Frankenstein by Charles E. Robinson in a new edition of the novel entitled The Original Frankenstein published by the Bodleian Library in Oxford and by Random House in the US. Robinson determined that Percy Bysshe Shelley was the co-author of the novel: \"He made very significant changes in words, themes and style. The book should now be credited as \\'by Mary Shelley with Percy Shelley\\'.\"In late 2014 Shelley\\'s work led lecturers from the University of Pennsylvania and New York University to produce a massive open online course (MOOC) on the life of Percy Shelley and Prometheus Unbound.\\n\\n\\n=== In popular culture ===\\nShelley is believed to have been the model for Marmion Herbert, one of two male protagonists in Benjamin Disraeli\\'s 1837 novel Venetia; the other, Lord Cadurcis, being based on Lord Byron.\\nHenry James\\'s 1888 novella The Aspern Papers relates a struggle to obtain some letters by Shelley years after his death. It was made into a stage play and an opera.\\nSpoon River Anthology by Edgar Lee Masters (1915) includes a poem Percy Bysshe Shelley as the namesake of the speaker, whose ashes \"were scattered near the pyramid of Caius Cestius / Somewhere near Rome.\"\\nHoward Brenton\\'s play, Bloody Poetry (1984), explores the complex relationships and rivalries between Shelley, Mary Shelley, Claire Clairmont, and Byron.\\nShelley\\'s cremation at Viareggio and the removal of his heart by Trelawny are described in Tennessee Williams\\'s 1953 play Camino Real by a fictional Lord Byron.\\nA visit to Lord Byron\\'s estate by Shelley and Mary Shelley is the setting for Ken Russell\\'s 1986 film Gothic.\\nA fictional Shelley befriends cavalry officer Matthew Hervey in the 2002 Allan Mallinson novel A Call to Arms.\\nNovelist Julian Rathbone fictionalises Shelley in A Very English Agent (2002), wherein a 19th-century government spy tampers with the poet\\'s boat, causing his death.\\nShelley appears as himself in Peter Ackroyd\\'s novel The Casebook of Victor Frankenstein (2008).\\nShelley was played by Ben Lamb in Shared Experience\\'s 2012 production, \"Mary Shelley\" by Helen Edmundson, at the Tricycle Theatre, London.\\nShelley\\'s poem \"Love\\'s Philosophy\" appears frequently both in the second season of the mystery television series Twin Peaks and in the first episode of the second season of Lewis named \"And the Moonbeams Kiss the Sea\".\\nShelley\\'s poem \"Ozymandias\" lends its name to an episode of Breaking Bad.

       " {'Title': 'Christina Rossetti',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'Christina Georgina Rossetti (5 December 1830 – 29 December 1894) was an English poet who wrote various romantic, devotional, and children\\'s poems. \"Goblin Market\" and \"Remember\" remain famous. She wrote the words of two Christmas carols well known in the UK: \"In the Bleak Midwinter\", later set by Gustav Holst and by Harold Darke, and \"Love Came Down at Christmas\", set by Harold Darke and by other composers.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nChristina Rossetti was born in Charlotte Street (now 110 Hallam Street), London, to Gabriele Rossetti, a poet and a political exile from Vasto, Abruzzo, since 1824 and Frances Polidori, the sister of Lord Byron\\'s friend and physician, John William Polidori. She had two brothers and a sister: Dante Gabriel became an influential artist and poet, and William Michael and Maria both became writers. Christina, the youngest, was a lively child. She dictated her first story to her mother before she had learned to write.Rossetti was educated at home by her mother and father, who had her study religious works, classics, fairy tales and novels. Rossetti delighted in the works of Keats, Scott, Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis. The influence of the work of Dante Alighieri, Petrarch and other Italian writers filled the home and would have a deep impact on Rossetti\\'s later writing. Their home was open to visiting Italian scholars, artists and revolutionaries. The family homes in Bloomsbury at 38 and later 50 Charlotte Street were within easy reach of Madam Tussauds, London Zoo and the newly opened Regent\\'s Park, which she visited regularly; in contrast to her parents, Rossetti was very much a London child, and, it seems, a happy one.\\n\\nIn the 1840s, her family faced severe financial difficulties due to the deterioration of her father\\'s physical and mental health. In 1843, he was diagnosed with persistent bronchitis, possibly tuberculosis, and faced losing his sight. He gave up his teaching post at King\\'s College and though he lived another 11 years, he suffered from depression and was never physically well again. Rossetti\\'s mother began teaching to keep the family out of poverty and Maria became a live-in governess, a prospect that Christina Rossetti dreaded. At this time her brother William was working for the Excise Office and Gabriel was at art school, leaving Christina\\'s life at home to become one of increasing isolation. When she was 14, Rossetti suffered a nervous breakdown and left school. Bouts of depression and related illness followed. During this period she, her mother and her sister became absorbed in the Anglo-Catholic movement that developed in the Church of England. Religious devotion came to play a major role in Rossetti\\'s life.\\nIn her late teens, Rossetti became engaged to the painter James Collinson, the first of three suitors. He was, like her brothers Dante and William, one of the founding members of the avant-garde artistic group, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (founded 1848). The engagement was broken in 1850 when he reverted to Catholicism. In 1853, when the Rossetti family was in continuing financial difficulties, Christina helped her mother keep a school in Fromefield, Frome, but it was not a success. (A plaque commemorates the house.) In 1854 the pair returned to London, where Christina\\'s father died. Later she became involved with the linguist Charles Cayley, but declined to marry him, also for religious reasons. The third offer came from the painter John Brett, whom she likewise refused.Rossetti sat for several of Dante Gabriel Rossetti\\'s most famous paintings. In 1848, she was the model for the Virgin Mary in his first completed oil painting, The Girlhood of Mary Virgin, and the first work to be inscribed with the initials \"PRB\", later revealed to signify the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The following year she modelled for his depiction of the Annunciation, Ecce Ancilla Domini. A line from her poem \"Who shall deliver me?\" inspired the famous painting by Fernand Khnopff called I lock my door upon myself. In 1849 she became seriously ill again, suffering from depression and sometime around 1857 had a major religious crisis.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nRossetti began writing down and dating her poems from 1842, most of which imitated her favoured poets. In 1847 she began experimenting with verse forms such as sonnets, hymns and ballads, while drawing narratives from the Bible, folk tales and the lives of saints. Her early pieces often feature meditations on death and loss, in the Romantic tradition. She published her first two poems (\"Death\\'s Chill Between\", \"Heart\\'s Chill Between\") in the Athenaeum in 1848, when she was 18. Under the pseudonym \"Ellen Alleyne\" she contributed to the literary magazine, The Germ, published by the Pre-Raphaelites from January to April 1850 and edited by her brother William. This marked the beginning of her public career.Rossetti\\'s more critical reflections on the artistic movement begun by her brother find expression in her 1856 poem \"In the Artist\\'s Studio\". Here she reflects on seeing multiple paintings of the same model. For Rossetti, the artist\\'s idealised vision of the model\\'s character begins to overwhelm his work, until \"every canvas means/the one same meaning.\" Dinah Roe, in her introduction to the Penguin Classics collection of Pre-Raphaelite poetry, argues that this critique of her brother and similar male artists is not so much about \"the objectification of women\" as about \"the male artist\\'s self-worship\".\\n\\nRossetti\\'s most famous collection, Goblin Market and Other Poems, appeared in 1862, when she was 31. It received widespread critical praise, establishing her as the foremost female poet of the time. Hopkins, Swinburne and Tennyson lauded her, and with the death of Elizabeth Barrett Browning in 1861 she was hailed as her natural successor. The title poem is one of Rossetti\\'s best known. Although it is ostensibly about two sisters\\' misadventures with goblins, critics have interpreted the piece in a variety of ways, seeing it as an allegory about temptation and salvation, a commentary on Victorian gender roles and female agency, and a work about erotic desire and social redemption. Rossetti was a volunteer worker from 1859 to 1870 at the St Mary Magdalene house of charity in Highgate, a refuge for former prostitutes, and it is suggested that Goblin Market may have been inspired by the \"fallen women\" she came to know. There are parallels with Coleridge\\'s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner in both poems\\' religious themes of temptation, sin and redemption by vicarious suffering. Swinburne in 1883 dedicated A Century of Roundels to Rossetti, as she adopted his roundel form in a number of poems, for instance in Wife to Husband. She was ambivalent about women\\'s suffrage, but many scholars have found feminist themes in her poetry. She opposed slavery (in the American South), cruelty to animals (in the prevalent practice of animal experimentation), and the exploitation of girls in under-age prostitution.Rossetti maintained a large circle of friends and correspondents, and continued to write and publish for the rest of her life, focusing mainly on devotional writing and children\\'s poetry. In 1892, she wrote The Face of the Deep, a book of devotional prose, and oversaw production of a new and enlarged edition of Sing-Song in 1893.\\n\\n\\n== Later life ==\\n\\nIn the later decades of her life, Rossetti suffered from Graves\\' disease, diagnosed in 1872, suffering a near-fatal attack in the early 1870s. In 1893, she developed breast cancer and though the tumour was removed, there was a recurrence in September 1894. She died in Bloomsbury on 29 December 1894 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery. The place where she died, in Torrington Square, is marked with a stone tablet.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nAlthough Rossetti\\'s popularity in her lifetime did not approach that of the contemporaneous Elizabeth Barrett Browning, her standing remained strong after her death. Her popularity faded in the early 20th century in the wake of Modernism, although scholars began to explore Freudian themes in her work, such as religious and sexual repression, reaching for personal, biographical interpretations of her poetry. In the 1970s academics began to study her work again, looking beyond the lyrical Romantic sweetness to her mastery of prosody and versification. Feminists held her as symbol of constrained female genius, placed as a leader of 19th-century poets. Her writings strongly influenced the work of such writers as Ford Madox Ford, Virginia Woolf, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Elizabeth Jennings, and Philip Larkin. The critic Basil de Selincourt stated that she was \"all but our greatest woman poet... incomparably our greatest craftswoman... probably in the first twelve of the masters of English verse.\"\\n\\nRossetti\\'s Christmas poem \"In the Bleak Midwinter\" became widely known in the English-speaking world after her death, when it was set as a Christmas carol, first by Gustav Holst and later by Harold Darke. Her poem \"Love Came Down at Christmas\" (1885) has also been widely arranged as a carol. Rossetti is honoured with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Anglican Church on 27 April.In 1918, John Ireland set eight of her poems from Sing-Song: A Nursery Rhyme Book to music in his song cycle Mother and Child. The title of J. K. Rowling\\'s novel The Cuckoo\\'s Calling is based on a line in Rossetti\\'s poem A Dirge. The poem \"Song\" was an inspiration for Bear McCreary to write his musical composition When I Am Dead, published in 2015. Two of Rossetti\\'s poems, \"Where Sunless Rivers Weep\" and \"Weeping Willow\" were set to music by Barbara Arens in her All Beautiful & Splendid Things: 12 + 1 Piano Songs on Poems by Women (2017, Editions Musica Ferrum).\\nIn 2000, as one of the many Millennium projects across the country, a poetry stone was placed in what used to be the grounds of North Hill House in Frome. On one side is an excerpt from her poem, \"What Good Shall My Life Do Me\": \"Love lights the sun: love through the dark/Lights the moon\\'s evanescent arc:/Same Love lights up the glow-worms spark.\" She wrote of her brief stay in Frome, which had \"an abundance of green slopes and gentle declivities: no boldness or grandeur but plenty of peaceful beauty.\"In 2011, Rossetti was the subject of Radio 4\\'s programme In Our Time.\\n\\n\\n== Ancestry ==\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Poetry collections ===\\nVerses.

       " {'Title': 'Alfred, Lord Tennyson',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson  (6 August 1809 – 6 October 1892) was a British poet. He was the Poet Laureate of Great Britain and Ireland during much of Queen Victoria\\'s reign and remains one of the most popular British poets. In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the Chancellor\\'s Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, \"Timbuktu.\" He published his first solo collection of poems, Poems Chiefly Lyrical in 1830. \"Claribel\" and \"Mariana\", which remain some of Tennyson\\'s most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Tennyson\\'s early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.\\nTennyson also excelled at penning short lyrics, such as \"Break, Break, Break\", \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", \"Tears, Idle Tears\", and \"Crossing the Bar\". Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, such as \"Ulysses\", although \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\" was written to commemorate his friend Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet and student at Trinity College, Cambridge, after he died of a stroke at the age of 22. Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including Idylls of the King, \"Ulysses\", and \"Tithonus\". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success.\\nA number of phrases from Tennyson\\'s work have become commonplaces of the English language, including \"Nature, red in tooth and claw\" (In Memoriam A.H.H.), \"\\'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all\", \"Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die\", \"My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure\", \"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\", \"Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers\", and \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new\". He is the ninth most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nTennyson was born on 6 August 1809 in Somersby, Lincolnshire, England. He was born into a middle-class family distantly descended from John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers.\\n\\nHis father, George Clayton Tennyson (1778–1831), was rector of Somersby (1807–1831), also rector of Benniworth (1802–1831) and Bag Enderby, and vicar of Grimsby (1815). He raised a large family and \"was a man of superior abilities and varied attainments, who tried his hand with fair success in architecture, painting, music, and poetry. He was comfortably well off for a country clergyman and his shrewd money management enabled the family to spend summers at Mablethorpe and Skegness on the eastern coast of England\". Alfred Tennyson\\'s mother, Elizabeth Fytche (1781–1865), was the daughter of Stephen Fytche (1734–1799), vicar of St. James Church, Louth (1764) and rector of Withcall (1780), a small village between Horncastle and Louth. Tennyson\\'s father \"carefully attended to the education and training of his children\".\\nTennyson and two of his elder brothers were writing poetry in their teens and a collection of poems by all three was published locally when Alfred was only 17. One of those brothers, Charles Tennyson Turner, later married Louisa Sellwood, the younger sister of Alfred\\'s future wife; the other was Frederick Tennyson. Another of Tennyson\\'s brothers, Edward Tennyson, was institutionalised at a private asylum.\\n\\n\\n== Education and first publication ==\\nTennyson was a student of King Edward VI Grammar School, Louth from 1816 to 1820. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1827, where he joined a secret society called the Cambridge Apostles. A portrait of Tennyson by George Frederic Watts is in Trinity\\'s collection.At Cambridge, Tennyson met Arthur Hallam and William Henry Brookfield, who became his closest friends. His first publication was a collection of \"his boyish rhymes and those of his elder brother Charles\" entitled Poems by Two Brothers, published in 1827.In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the Chancellor\\'s Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, \"Timbuktu\". Reportedly, \"it was thought to be no slight honour for a young man of twenty to win the chancellor\\'s gold medal\". He published his first solo collection of poems, Poems Chiefly Lyrical in 1830. \"Claribel\" and \"Mariana\", which later took their place among Tennyson\\'s most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\\n\\n\\n== Return to Lincolnshire, second publication, Epping Forest ==\\nIn the spring of 1831, Tennyson\\'s father died, requiring him to leave Cambridge before taking his degree. He returned to the rectory, where he was permitted to live for another six years and shared responsibility for his widowed mother and the family. Arthur Hallam came to stay with his family during the summer and became engaged to Tennyson\\'s sister, Emilia Tennyson.\\n\\nIn 1833 Tennyson published his second book of poetry, which notably included the first version of The Lady of Shalott. The volume met heavy criticism, which so discouraged Tennyson that he did not publish again for ten years, although he did continue to write. That same year, Hallam died suddenly and unexpectedly after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage while on a holiday in Vienna. Hallam\\'s death had a profound effect on Tennyson and inspired several poems, including \"In the Valley of Cauteretz\" and In Memoriam A.H.H., a long poem detailing the \"Way of the Soul\".Tennyson and his family were allowed to stay in the rectory for some time, but later moved to Beech Hill Park, High Beach, deep within Epping Forest, Essex, about 1837. Tennyson\\'s son recalled: “there was a pond in the park on which in winter my father might be seen skating, sailing about on the ice in his long blue cloak. He liked the nearness of London, whither he resorted to see his friends, but he could not stay in town even for a night, his mother being in such a nervous state that he did not like to leave her...\". Tennyson befriended a Dr Allen, who ran a nearby asylum whose patients then included the poet John Clare. An unwise investment in Dr Allen\\'s ecclesiastical wood-carving enterprise soon led to the loss of much of the family fortune, and led to a bout of serious depression. Tennyson moved to London in 1840 and lived for a time at Chapel House, Twickenham.\\n\\n\\n== Third publication ==\\n\\nIn 1842, while living modestly in London, Tennyson published the two volume Poems, of which the first included works already published and the second was made up almost entirely of new poems. They met with immediate success; poems from this collection, such as Locksley Hall, \"Break, Break, Break\", and Ulysses, and a new version of The Lady of Shallot, have met enduring fame. The Princess: A Medley, a satire on women\\'s education that came out in 1847, was also popular for its lyrics. W. S. Gilbert later adapted and parodied the piece twice: in The Princess (1870) and in Princess Ida (1884).\\n\\nIt was in 1850 that Tennyson reached the pinnacle of his career, finally publishing his masterpiece, In Memoriam A.H.H., dedicated to Hallam. Later the same year, he was appointed Poet Laureate, succeeding William Wordsworth. In the same year (on 13 June), Tennyson married Emily Sellwood, whom he had known since childhood, in the village of Shiplake. They had two sons, Hallam Tennyson (b. 11 August 1852)—named after his friend—and Lionel (b. 16 March 1854).\\n\\nTennyson rented Farringford House on the Isle of Wight in 1853, eventually buying it in 1856. He eventually found that there were too many starstruck tourists who pestered him in Farringford, so he moved to Aldworth, in West Sussex in 1869. However, he retained Farringford, and regularly returned there to spend the winters.\\n\\n\\n== Poet Laureate ==\\nIn 1850, after William Wordsworth\\'s death and Samuel Rogers\\' refusal, Tennyson was appointed to the position of Poet Laureate; Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Leigh Hunt had also been considered. He held the position until his own death in 1892, the longest tenure of any laureate. Tennyson fulfilled the requirements of this position by turning out appropriate but often uninspired verse, such as a poem of greeting to Princess Alexandra of Denmark when she arrived in Britain to marry the future King Edward VII. In 1855, Tennyson produced one of his best-known works, \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", a dramatic tribute to the British cavalrymen involved in an ill-advised charge on 25 October 1854, during the Crimean War. Other esteemed works written in the post of Poet Laureate include \"Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington\" and \"Ode Sung at the Opening of the International Exhibition\".\\n\\nTennyson initially declined a baronetcy in 1865 and 1868 (when tendered by Disraeli), finally accepting a peerage in 1883 at Gladstone\\'s earnest solicitation. In 1884 Victoria created him Baron Tennyson, of Aldworth in the County of Sussex and of Freshwater in the Isle of Wight. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 11 March 1884.Tennyson also wrote a substantial quantity of unofficial political verse, from the bellicose \"Form, Riflemen, Form\", on the French crisis of 1859 and the Creation of the Volunteer Force, to \"Steersman, be not precipitate in thine act/of steering\", deploring Gladstone\\'s Home Rule Bill. Tennyson\\'s family were Whigs by tradition and Tennyson\\'s own politics fitted the Whig mould, although he would also vote for the Liberal Party after the Whigs dissolved. Tennyson believed that society should progress through gradual and steady reform, not revolution, and this attitude was reflected in his attitude toward universal suffrage, which he did not outright reject, but recommended only after the masses had been properly educated and adjusted to self-government. Upon passage of the 1832 Reform Act, Tennyson broke into a local church to ring the bells in celebration.Virginia Woolf wrote a play called Freshwater, showing Tennyson as host to his friends Julia Margaret Cameron and G.F. Watts.Tennyson was the first to be raised to a British peerage for his writing. A passionate man with some peculiarities of nature, he was never particularly comfortable as a peer, and it is widely held that he took the peerage in order to secure a future for his son Hallam.Colonel George Edward Gouraud, Thomas Edison\\'s European agent, made sound recordings of Tennyson reading his own poetry, late in his life. They include recordings of \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\", and excerpts from \"The splendour falls\" (from The Princess), \"Come into the garden\" (from Maud), \"Ask me no more\", \"Ode on the death of the Duke of Wellington\" and \"Lancelot and Elaine\". The sound quality is poor, as wax cylinder recordings usually are.\\n\\nTowards the end of his life Tennyson revealed that his \"religious beliefs also defied convention, leaning towards agnosticism and pandeism\": In a characteristically Victorian manner, Tennyson combines a deep interest in contemporary science with an unorthodox, even idiosyncratic, Christian belief. Famously, he wrote in In Memoriam: \"There lives more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in half the creeds.\" In Maud, 1855, he wrote: \"The churches have killed their Christ\". In \"Locksley Hall Sixty Years After,\" Tennyson wrote: \"Christian love among the churches look\\'d the twin of heathen hate.\" In his play, Becket, he wrote: \"We are self-uncertain creatures, and we may, Yea, even when we know not, mix our spites and private hates with our defence of Heaven\". Tennyson recorded in his Diary (p. 127): \"I believe in Pantheism of a sort\". His son\\'s biography confirms that Tennyson was an unorthodox Christian, noting that Tennyson praised Giordano Bruno and Spinoza on his deathbed, saying of Bruno, \"His view of God is in some ways mine\", in 1892.\\n\\nTennyson continued writing into his eighties. He died on 6 October 1892 at Aldworth, aged 83. He was buried at Westminster Abbey. A memorial was erected in All Saints\\' Church, Freshwater. His last words were, \"Oh that press will have me now!\". He left an estate of £57,206. Tennyson Down and the Tennyson Trail on the Isle of Wight are named after him, and a monument to him stands on top of Tennyson Down. Lake Tennyson in New Zealand\\'s high country, named by Frederick Weld, is assumed to be named after Lord Tennyson.He was succeeded as 2nd Baron Tennyson by his son, Hallam, who produced an authorised biography of his father in 1897, and was later the second Governor-General of Australia.\\n\\n\\n== Tennyson and the Queen ==\\nAlthough Prince Albert was largely responsible for Tennyson\\'s appointment as Laureate, Queen Victoria became an ardent admirer of Tennyson\\'s work, writing in her diary that she was \"much soothed & pleased\" by reading \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\" after Albert\\'s death.The two met twice, first in April 1862, when Victoria wrote in her diary, \"very peculiar looking, tall, dark, with a fine head, long black flowing hair & a beard, oddly dressed, but there is no affectation about him.\"Tennyson met her a second time just over two decades later, on 7 August 1883, and the Queen told him what a comfort \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\" had been.\\n\\n\\n== The art of Tennyson\\'s poetry ==\\nAs source material for his poetry, Tennyson used a wide range of subject matter ranging from medieval legends to classical myths and from domestic situations to observations of nature. The influence of John Keats and other Romantic poets published before and during his childhood is evident from the richness of his imagery and descriptive writing. He also handled rhythm masterfully. The insistent beat of Break, Break, Break emphasises the relentless sadness of the subject matter. Tennyson\\'s use of the musical qualities of words to emphasise his rhythms and meanings is sensitive. The language of \"I come from haunts of coot and hern\" lilts and ripples like the brook in the poem and the last two lines of \"Come down O maid from yonder mountain height\" illustrate his telling combination of onomatopoeia, alliteration, and assonance:\\n\\nThe moan of doves in immemorial elms\\nAnd murmuring of innumerable bees.Tennyson was a craftsman who polished and revised his manuscripts extensively, to the point where his efforts at self-editing were described by his contemporary Robert Browning as \"insane\", symptomatic of \"mental infirmity\". His complex compositional practice and frequent redrafting also demonstrates a dynamic relationship between images and text, as can be seen in the many notebooks he worked in. Few poets have used such a variety of styles with such an exact understanding of metre; like many Victorian poets, he experimented in adapting the quantitative metres of Greek and Latin poetry to English. He reflects the Victorian period of his maturity in his feeling for order and his tendency towards moralising. He also reflects a concern common among Victorian writers in being troubled by the conflict between religious faith and expanding scientific knowledge. Tennyson possessed a strong poetic power, which his early readers often attributed to his \"Englishness\" and his masculinity. Well known among his longer works are Maud and Idylls of the King, the latter arguably the most famous Victorian adaptation of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. A common thread of grief, melancholy, and loss connects much of his poetry (including Mariana, The Lotos Eaters, Tears, Idle Tears, In Memoriam), possibly reflecting Tennyson\\'s own lifelong struggle with debilitating depression. T. S. Eliot famously described Tennyson as \"the saddest of all English poets\", whose technical mastery of verse and language provided a \"surface\" to his poetry\\'s \"depths, to the abyss of sorrow\". Other poets such as W. H. Auden maintained a more critical stance, stating that Tennyson was the \"stupidest\" of all the English poets, adding that: \"There was little about melancholia he didn\\'t know; there was little else that he did.\"\\n\\n\\n== Influence on Pre-Raphaelite artists ==\\nTennyson\\'s early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. In 1848, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt made a list of \"Immortals\", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, notably including Keats and Tennyson, whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings. The Lady of Shalott alone was a subject for Rossetti, Hunt, John William Waterhouse (three versions), and Elizabeth Siddall.\\n\\n\\n== Tennyson heraldry ==\\n\\nAn heraldic achievement of Alfred, Lord Tennyson exists in an 1884 stained-glass window in the Hall of Trinity College, Cambridge, showing arms: Gules, a bend nebuly or thereon a chaplet vert between three leopard\\'s faces jessant-de-lys of the second; Crest: A dexter arm in armour the hand in a gauntlet or grasping a broken tilting spear enfiled with a garland of laurel; Supporters: Two leopards rampant guardant gules semée de lys and ducally crowned or; Motto: Respiciens Prospiciens (\"Looking backwards (is) looking forwards\"). These are a difference of the arms of Thomas Tenison (1636–1715), Archbishop of Canterbury, themselves a difference of the arms of the 13th-century Denys family of Glamorgan and Siston in Gloucestershire, themselves a difference of the arms of Thomas de Cantilupe (c. 1218–1282), Bishop of Hereford, henceforth the arms of the See of Hereford; the name \"Tennyson\" signifies \"Denys\\'s son\", although no connection between the two families is recorded.\\n\\n\\n== Partial list of works ==\\nFrom Poems, Chiefly Lyrical (1830):\\n\"Nothing Will Die\"\\n\"All Things Will Die\"\\n\"The Dying Swan\"\\n\"The Kraken\"\\n\"Mariana\"\\n\"Lady Clara Vere de Vere\" (1832)\\nFrom Poems (1833):\\n\"The Lotos-Eaters\"\\n\"The Lady of Shalott\" (1832, 1842) – three versions painted by J.

       " {'Title': 'Robert Browning',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'Robert Browning (7 May 1812 – 12 December 1889) was an English poet and playwright whose mastery of the dramatic monologue made him one of the foremost Victorian poets. His poems are known for their irony, characterization, dark humour, social commentary, historical settings, and challenging vocabulary and syntax.\\nBrowning\\'s early career began promisingly, but collapsed. The long poems Pauline and Paracelsus received some acclaim, but in 1840 the difficult Sordello, which was seen as wilfully obscure, brought his poetry into disrepute. His reputation took more than a decade to recover, during which time he moved away from the Shelleyan forms of his early period and developed a more personal style.\\nIn 1846, Browning married the older poet Elizabeth Barrett, and went to live in Italy. By the time of her death in 1861, he had published the crucial collection Men and Women. The collection Dramatis Personae and the book-length epic poem The Ring and the Book followed, and made him a leading British poet. He continued to write prolifically, but his reputation today rests largely on the poetry he wrote in this middle period.\\nWhen Browning died in 1889, he was regarded as a sage and philosopher-poet who through his writing had made contributions to Victorian social and political discourse.   Unusually for a poet, societies for the study of his work were founded while he was still alive. Such Browning Societies remained common in Britain and the United States until the early 20th century.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early years ===\\nRobert Browning was born in Walworth in the parish of Camberwell, Surrey, which now forms part of the Borough of Southwark in south London. He was baptized on 14 June 1812, at Lock\\'s Fields Independent Chapel, York Street, Walworth, the only son of Sarah Anna (née Wiedemann) and Robert Browning. His father was a well-paid clerk for the Bank of England, earning about £150 per year. Browning\\'s paternal grandfather was a slave owner in Saint Kitts, West Indies, but Browning\\'s father was an abolitionist. Browning\\'s father had been sent to the West Indies to work on a sugar plantation, but, due to a slave revolt there, had returned to England. Browning\\'s mother was the daughter of a German shipowner who had settled in Dundee in Scotland, and his Scottish wife. Browning had one sister, Sarianna. Browning\\'s paternal grandmother, Margaret Tittle, who had inherited a plantation in St Kitts, was rumoured (within the family) to have a mixed race ancestry, including some Jamaican blood, but author Julia Markus suggests she was Kittitian rather than Jamaican. The evidence, however, is inconclusive. Robert\\'s father, a literary collector, amassed a library of around 6,000 books, many of them rare. As such, Robert was raised in a household of significant literary resources. His mother, to whom he was very close, was a devout nonconformist and a talented musician. His younger sister, Sarianna, also gifted, became her brother\\'s companion in his later years, after the death of his wife in 1861. His father encouraged his children\\'s interest in literature and the arts.By 12, Browning had written a book of poetry which he later destroyed when no publisher could be found. After being at one or two private schools, and showing an insuperable dislike of school life, he was educated at home by a tutor via the resources of his father\\'s extensive library. By 14 he was fluent in French, Greek, Italian and Latin. He became a great admirer of the Romantic poets, especially Shelley. Following the precedent of Shelley, Browning became an atheist and vegetarian. At 16, he studied Greek at University College London but left after his first year. His parents\\' staunch evangelical faith prevented his studying at either Oxford or Cambridge University, both then open only to members of the Church of England. He had inherited substantial musical ability through his mother, and composed arrangements of various songs. He refused a formal career and ignored his parents\\' remonstrations, dedicating himself to poetry. He stayed at home until the age of 34, financially dependent on his family until his marriage. His father sponsored the publication of his son\\'s poems.\\n\\n\\n=== First published works ===\\nIn March 1833, \"Pauline, a Fragment of a Confession\" was published anonymously by Saunders and Otley at the expense of the author, Robert Browning, who received the money from his aunt, Mrs Silverthorne. It is a long poem composed in homage to Shelley and somewhat in his style. Originally Browning considered Pauline as the first of a series written by different aspects of himself, but he soon abandoned this idea. The press noticed the publication. W. J. Fox writing in The Monthly Repository of April 1833 discerned merit in the work. Allan Cunningham praised it in the Athenaeum. However, it sold no copies. Some years later, probably in 1850, Dante Gabriel Rossetti came across it in the Reading Room of the British Museum and wrote to Browning, then in Florence to ask if he was the author. John Stuart Mill, however, wrote that the author suffered from an \"intense and morbid self-consciousness\". Later Browning was rather embarrassed by the work, and only included it in his collected poems of 1868 after making substantial changes and adding a preface in which he asked for indulgence for a boyish work.In 1834, he accompanied the Chevalier George de Benkhausen, the Russian consul-general, on a brief visit to St Petersburg and began Paracelsus, which was published in 1835. The subject of the 16th-century savant and alchemist was probably suggested to him by the Comte Amédée de Ripart-Monclar, to whom it was dedicated. The publication had some commercial and critical success, being noticed by Wordsworth, Dickens, Landor, J. S. Mill and the already famous Tennyson. It is a monodrama without action, dealing with the problems confronting an intellectual trying to find his role in society. It gained him access to the London literary world.\\nAs a result of his new contacts he met Macready, who invited him to write a play. Strafford was performed five times. Browning then wrote two other plays, one of which was not performed, while the other failed, Browning having fallen out with Macready.\\nIn 1838, he visited Italy looking for background for Sordello, a long poem in heroic couplets, presented as the imaginary biography of the Mantuan bard spoken of by Dante in the Divine Comedy, canto 6 of Purgatory, set against a background of hate and conflict during the Guelph-Ghibelline wars. This was published in 1840 and met with widespread derision, gaining him the reputation of wanton carelessness and obscurity. Tennyson commented that he only understood the first and last lines and Carlyle wrote that his wife had read the poem through and could not tell whether Sordello was a man, a city or a book.Browning\\'s reputation began to make a partial recovery with the publication, 1841–1846, of Bells and Pomegranates, a series of eight pamphlets, originally intended just to include his plays. Fortunately for Browning\\'s career, his publisher, Moxon, persuaded him to include some \"dramatic lyrics\", some of which had already appeared in periodicals.\\n\\n\\n=== Marriage ===\\n\\nIn 1845, Browning met the poet Elizabeth Barrett, six years his elder, who lived as a semi-invalid in her father\\'s house in Wimpole Street, London. They began regularly corresponding and gradually a romance developed between them, leading to their marriage and journey to Italy (for Elizabeth\\'s health) on 12 September 1846. The marriage was initially secret because Elizabeth\\'s domineering father disapproved of marriage for any of his children. Mr. Barrett disinherited Elizabeth, as he did for each of his children who married: \"The Mrs. Browning of popular imagination was a sweet, innocent young woman who suffered endless cruelties at the hands of a tyrannical papa but who nonetheless had the good fortune to fall in love with a dashing and handsome poet named Robert Browning.\" At her husband\\'s insistence, the second edition of Elizabeth’s Poems included her love sonnets. The book increased her popularity and high critical regard, cementing her position as an eminent Victorian poet. Upon William Wordsworth\\'s death in 1850, she was a serious contender to become Poet Laureate, the position eventually going to Tennyson.\\nFrom the time of their marriage and until Elizabeth\\'s death, the Brownings lived in Italy, residing first in Pisa, and then, within a year, finding an apartment in Florence at Casa Guidi (now a museum to their memory). Their only child, Robert Wiedemann Barrett Browning, nicknamed \"Penini\" or \"Pen\", was born in 1849. In these years Browning was fascinated by, and learned from, the art and atmosphere of Italy. He would, in later life, describe Italy as his university. As Elizabeth had inherited money of her own, the couple were reasonably comfortable in Italy, and their relationship together was happy. However, the literary assault on Browning\\'s work did not let up and he was critically dismissed further, by patrician writers such as Charles Kingsley, for the desertion of England for foreign lands.\\n\\n\\n=== Political views ===\\nBrowning identified as a Liberal, supported the emancipation of women, and opposed slavery, expressing sympathy for the North in the American Civil War. Later in life, he even championed animal rights in several poems attacking vivisection. He was also a stalwart opponent of anti-Semitism, leading to speculation that Browning himself was Jewish. In 1877 he wrote a poem explaining \"Why I am a Liberal\" in which he declared: \"Who then dares hold – emancipated thus / His fellow shall continue bound? Not I.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Religious beliefs ===\\nBrowning was raised in an evangelical non-conformist household. However, after his reading of Shelley he is said to have briefly become an atheist. Browning is also said to have made an uncharacteristic admission of faith to Alfred Domett, when he is said to have admired Byron\\'s poetry \"as a Christian\". Poems such as \"Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day\" seem to confirm this Christian faith, strengthened by his wife. However, many have dismissed the usefulness of these works at discovering Browning\\'s own religious views due to the consistent use of dramatic monologue which regularly expresses hypothetical views which cannot be ascribed to the author himself.\\n\\n\\n=== Spiritualism incident ===\\n\\nBrowning believed spiritualism to be fraud, and proved one of Daniel Dunglas Home\\'s most adamant critics. When Browning and his wife Elizabeth attended one of his séances on 23 July 1855, a spirit face materialized, which Home claimed was Browning\\'s son who had died in infancy: Browning seized the \"materialization\" and discovered it to be Home\\'s bare foot. To make the deception worse, Browning had never lost a son in infancy.After the séance, Browning wrote an angry letter to The Times, in which he said: \"the whole display of hands, spirit utterances etc., was a cheat and imposture.\" In 1902 Browning\\'s son Pen wrote: \"Home was detected in a vulgar fraud.\" Elizabeth, however, was convinced that the phenomena she witnessed were genuine, and her discussions about Home with her husband were a constant source of disagreement.\\n\\n\\n=== Major works ===\\n\\nIn Florence, probably from early in 1853, Browning worked on the poems that eventually comprised his two-volume Men and Women, for which he is now well known, although in 1855, when they were published, they made relatively little impact.\\nIn 1861, Elizabeth died in Florence. Among those whom he found consoling in that period was the novelist and poet Isa Blagden, with whom he and his wife had a voluminous correspondence. The following year Browning returned to London, taking Pen with him, who by then was 12 years old. They made their home in 17 Warwick Crescent, Maida Vale. It was only when he became part of the London literary scene—albeit while paying frequent visits to Italy (though never again to Florence)—that his reputation started to take off.In 1868, after five years work he completed and published the long blank-verse poem The Ring and the Book. Based on a convoluted murder-case from 1690s Rome, the poem is composed of 12 books: essentially 10 lengthy dramatic monologues narrated by various characters in the story, showing their individual perspectives on events, bookended by an introduction and conclusion by Browning himself. Long even by Browning\\'s standards (over twenty-thousand lines), The Ring and the Book was his most ambitious project and is arguably his greatest work; it has been called a tour de force of dramatic poetry. Published in four parts from November 1868 to February 1869, the poem was a success both commercially and critically, and finally brought Browning the renown he had sought for nearly 40 years. The Robert Browning Society was formed in 1881 and his work was recognised as belonging within the British literary canon.\\n\\n\\n=== Last years and death ===\\n\\nIn the remaining years of his life Browning travelled extensively. After a series of long poems published in the early 1870s, of which Balaustion\\'s Adventure and Red Cotton Night-Cap Country were the best-received, the volume Pacchiarotto, and How He Worked in Distemper included an attack against Browning\\'s critics, especially Alfred Austin, who was later to become Poet Laureate. According to some reports Browning became romantically involved with Louisa Caroline Stewart-Mackenzie, Lady Ashburton, but he refused her proposal of marriage, and did not remarry. In 1878, he revisited Italy for the first time in the seventeen years since Elizabeth\\'s death, and returned there on several further occasions. In 1887, Browning produced the major work of his later years, Parleyings with Certain People of Importance in Their Day. It finally presented the poet speaking in his own voice, engaging in a series of dialogues with long-forgotten figures of literary, artistic, and philosophic history. The Victorian public was baffled by this, and Browning returned to the brief, concise lyric for his last volume, Asolando (1889), published on the day of his death.Browning died at his son\\'s home Ca\\' Rezzonico in Venice on 12 December 1889. He was buried in Poets\\' Corner in Westminster Abbey; his grave now lies immediately adjacent to that of Alfred Tennyson.During his life Browning was awarded many distinctions. He was made LL.D. of Edinburgh, a life Governor of London University, and had the offer of the Lord Rectorship of Glasgow. But he turned down anything that involved public speaking.\\n\\n\\n== History of sound recording ==\\nAt a dinner party on 7 April 1889, at the home of Browning\\'s friend the artist Rudolf Lehmann, an Edison cylinder phonograph recording was made on a white wax cylinder by Edison\\'s British representative, George Gouraud. In the recording, which still exists, Browning recites part of How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix (and can be heard apologising when he forgets the words).\\nWhen the recording was played in 1890 on the anniversary of his death, at a gathering of his admirers, it was said to be the first time anyone\\'s voice \"had been heard from beyond the grave\".\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\nBrowning\\'s admirers have tended to temper their praise with reservations about the length and difficulty of his most ambitious poems, particularly Sordello and, to a lesser extent, The Ring and the Book. Nevertheless, they have included such eminent writers as Henry James, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, G. K. Chesterton, Ezra Pound, Jorge Luis Borges, and Vladimir Nabokov. Among living writers, Stephen King\\'s The Dark Tower series and A. S. Byatt\\'s Possession refer directly to Browning\\'s work.\\nToday Browning\\'s critically most esteemed poems include the monologues Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came, Fra Lippo Lippi, Andrea Del Sarto, and My Last Duchess. His most popular poems include Porphyria\\'s Lover, How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix, the diptych Meeting at Night, the patriotic Home Thoughts from Abroad, and the children\\'s poem The Pied Piper of Hamelin. His abortive dinner-party recital of How They Brought The Good News was recorded on an Edison wax cylinder, and is believed to be the oldest surviving recording made in the United Kingdom of a notable person.\\nBrowning is now popularly known for such poems as Porphyria\\'s Lover, My Last Duchess, How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix, and The Pied Piper of Hamelin, and also for certain famous lines: \"Grow old along with me!\" (Rabbi Ben Ezra), \"A man\\'s reach should exceed his grasp\" and \"Less is more\" (Andrea Del Sarto), \"It was roses, roses all the way\" (The Patriot), and \"God\\'s in His heaven—All\\'s right with the world!\" (Pippa Passes).\\nHis critical reputation rests mainly on his dramatic monologues, in which the words not only convey setting and action but reveal the speaker\\'s character. In a Browning monologue, unlike a soliloquy, the meaning is not what the speaker voluntarily reveals but what he inadvertently gives away, usually while rationalising past actions or special pleading his case to a silent auditor. These monologues have been influential, and today the best of them are often treated by teachers and lecturers as paradigm cases of the monologue form. One such example used by teachers today is his satirization of the sadistic attitude in his Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister. Ian Jack, in his introduction to the Oxford University Press edition of Browning\\'s poems 1833–1864, comments that Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot \"all learned from Browning\\'s exploration of the possibilities of dramatic poetry and of colloquial idiom\".In Oscar Wilde\\'s dialogue The Critic as Artist, Browning is given a famously ironical assessment: \"He is the most Shakespearean creature since Shakespeare. If Shakespeare could sing with myriad lips, Browning could stammer through a thousand mouths. [...] Yes, Browning was great. And as what will he be remembered? As a poet? Ah, not as a poet! He will be remembered as a writer of fiction, as the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, that we have ever had. His sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled, and, if he could not answer his own problems, he could at least put problems forth, and what more should an artist do? Considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made Hamlet. Had he been articulate, he might have sat beside him. The only man who can touch the hem of his garment is George Meredith. Meredith is a prose Browning, and so is Browning. He used poetry as a medium for writing in prose.\"\\nProbably the most adulatory judgment of Browning by a modern critic comes from Harold Bloom: \"Browning is the most considerable poet in English since the major Romantics, surpassing his great contemporary rival Tennyson and the principal twentieth-century poets, including even Yeats, Hardy, and Wallace Stevens. But Browning is a very difficult poet, notoriously badly served by criticism, and ill-served also by his own accounts of what he was doing as a poet. [...] Yet when you read your way into his world, precisely his largest gift to you is his involuntary unfolding of one of the largest, most enigmatic, and most multipersoned literary and human selves you can hope to encounter.\"His work has nevertheless had many detractors, and most of his voluminous output is not widely read. In a largely hostile essay Anthony Burgess wrote: \"We all want to like Browning, but we find it very hard.\" Gerard Manley Hopkins and George Santayana were also critical. The latter expressed his views in the essay \"The Poetry of Barbarism,\" which attacks Browning and Walt Whitman for what he regarded as their embrace of irrationality.\\n\\n\\n== Cultural references ==\\n\\nIn 1914 American modernist composer Charles Ives created the Robert Browning Overture, a dense and darkly dramatic piece with gloomy overtones reminiscent of the Second Viennese School.\\nIn 1930 the story of Browning and his wife was made into the play The Barretts of Wimpole Street, by Rudolph Besier. It was a success and brought popular fame to the couple in the United States. The role of Elizabeth became a signature role for the actress Katharine Cornell. It was twice adapted into film. It was also the basis of the stage musical Robert and Elizabeth, with music by Ron Grainer and book and lyrics by Ronald Millar.\\nIn The Browning Version (Terence Rattigan\\'s 1948 play or one of several film adaptations), a pupil makes a parting present to his teacher of an inscribed copy of Browning\\'s translation of the Agamemnon.\\nStephen King\\'s The Dark Tower was chiefly inspired by Browning\\'s Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came, whose full text was included in the final volume\\'s appendix.\\nMichael Dibdin\\'s 1986 crime novel \"A Rich Full Death\" features Robert Browning as one of the lead characters.\\nLines from Paracelsus were recited by the character Fox Mulder at the beginning and the end of the 1996 The X-Files episode \"The Field Where I Died\".\\nGabrielle Kimm\\'s 2010 novel His Last Duchess is inspired by My Last Duchess.\\nA memorial plaque on the site of Browning\\'s London home, in Warwick Crescent, Maida Vale, was unveiled on 11 December 1993.Locations named for him include the following: \\n\\nRobert Browning Elementary School, Houston, Texas, USA\\nWays in areas known as \"Poets\\' Corner\":\\nBrowning Trail in Barrie, Ontario\\nBrowning Close in Royston, Hertfordshire\\nBrowning Street in Berkeley, California\\nBrowning Street in Yokine, Western Australia\\nBrowning Street and Robert Browning School in Walworth, London (near to his birthplace in Camberwell)\\nTwo culs-de-sac in Little Venice, London (Browning Close and Robert Close).

       " {'Title': 'Elizabeth Barrett Browning',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'Elizabeth Barrett Browning (née Moulton-Barrett, ; 6 March 1806 – 29 June 1861) was an English poet of the Victorian era, popular in Britain and the United States during her lifetime.\\nBorn in County Durham, the eldest of 12 children, Elizabeth Barrett wrote poetry from the age of eleven. Her mother\\'s collection of her poems forms one of the largest extant collections of juvenilia by any English writer. At 15 she became ill, suffering intense head and spinal pain for the rest of her life. Later in life she also developed lung problems, possibly tuberculosis. She took laudanum for the pain from an early age, which is likely to have contributed to her frail health. \\nIn the 1840s Elizabeth was introduced to literary society through her cousin, John Kenyon. Her first adult collection of poems was published in 1838 and she wrote prolifically between 1841 and 1844, producing poetry, translation and prose. She campaigned for the abolition of slavery and her work helped influence reform in the child labour legislation. Her prolific output made her a rival to Tennyson as a candidate for poet laureate on the death of Wordsworth.\\nElizabeth\\'s volume Poems (1844) brought her great success, attracting the admiration of the writer Robert Browning. Their correspondence, courtship and marriage were carried out in secret, for fear of her father\\'s disapproval. Following the wedding she was indeed disinherited by her father. The couple moved to Italy in 1846, where she would live for the rest of her life. They had one son, Robert Wiedeman Barrett Browning, whom they called Pen. She died in Florence in 1861. A collection of her last poems was published by her husband shortly after her death.\\nElizabeth\\'s work had a major influence on prominent writers of the day, including the American poets Edgar Allan Poe and Emily Dickinson. She is remembered for such poems as \"How Do I Love Thee?\" (Sonnet 43, 1845) and Aurora Leigh (1856).\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family background ===\\nSome of Elizabeth Barrett\\'s family had lived in Jamaica since 1655. Their wealth derived mainly from Edward Barrett (1734–1798), owner of 10,000 acres (4,000 ha) in the estates of Cinnamon Hill, Cornwall, Cambridge and Oxford in northern Jamaica. Elizabeth\\'s maternal grandfather owned sugar plantations, mills, glassworks and ships that traded between Jamaica and Newcastle. Biographer Julia Markus states the poet \"believed that she had African blood through her grandfather Charles Moulton\", but there is no evidence of this – although other branches of her family had African blood through relationships between plantation owners and slaves. What the family believed to be their genealogy in relation to Jamaica is unclear.The family wished to hand down their name, stipulating that Barrett should always be held as a surname. In some cases inheritance was given on condition that the name was used by the beneficiary; the English gentry and \"squirearchy\" had long encouraged this sort of name changing. Given this strong tradition, Elizabeth used \"Elizabeth Barrett Moulton Barrett\" on legal documents and before she was married often signed herself \"Elizabeth Barrett Barrett\" or \"EBB\" (initials which she was able to keep after her wedding).Elizabeth\\'s father chose to raise his family in England while his business enterprises remained in Jamaica. The fortune of Elizabeth\\'s mother\\'s line, the Graham Clarke family, also derived in part from slave labour, and was considerable.\\n\\n\\n=== Early life ===\\nElizabeth Barrett Moulton-Barrett was born on 6 March 1806, in Coxhoe Hall, between the villages of Coxhoe and Kelloe in County Durham, England. Her parents were Edward Barrett Moulton Barrett and Mary Graham Clarke; Elizabeth was the eldest of 12 children (eight boys and four girls). All lived to adulthood except for one girl, who died at the age of three, when Elizabeth was eight.\\nThe children all had nicknames: Elizabeth was \"Ba\". She rode her pony, went for family walks and picnics, socialised with other county families, and participated in home theatrical productions. But unlike her siblings, she immersed herself in books as often as she could get away from the social rituals of her family.\\nShe was baptized in 1809 at Kelloe parish church, although she had already been baptised by a family friend in her first week of life.\\nIn 1809, the family moved to Hope End, a 500-acre (200 ha) estate near the Malvern Hills in Ledbury, Herefordshire. Her father converted the Georgian house into stables and built a new mansion of opulent Turkish design, which his wife described as something from the Arabian Nights Entertainments.\\nThe interior\\'s brass balustrades, mahogany doors inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and finely carved fireplaces were eventually complemented by lavish landscaping: ponds, grottos, kiosks, an ice house, a hothouse, and a subterranean passage from house to gardens. Her time at Hope End would inspire her in later life to write her most ambitious work, Aurora Leigh (1856), which went through more than 20 editions by 1900, but none between 1905 and 1978.\\n\\nShe was educated at home and tutored by Daniel McSwiney with her oldest brother. She began writing verses at the age of four. During the Hope End period, she was an intensely studious, precocious child. She claimed that at the age of six she was reading novels, at eight entranced by Pope\\'s translations of Homer, studying Greek at ten, and at eleven writing her own Homeric epic, The Battle of Marathon: A Poem.In 1820 Mr Barrett privately published The Battle of Marathon, an epic-style poem, though all copies remained within the family. Her mother compiled the child\\'s poetry into collections of \"Poems by Elizabeth B. Barrett\". Her father called her the \"Poet Laureate of Hope End\" and encouraged her work. The result is one of the largest collections of juvenilia of any English writer. Mary Russell Mitford described the young Elizabeth at this time, as having \"a slight, delicate figure, with a shower of dark curls falling on each side of a most expressive face; large, tender eyes, richly fringed by dark eyelashes, and a smile like a sunbeam.\"\\nAt about this time, Elizabeth began to battle with illness, which the medical science of the time was unable to diagnose. All three sisters came down with the syndrome although it lasted only with Elizabeth. She had intense head and spinal pain with loss of mobility. Various biographies link this to a riding accident at the time (she fell while trying to dismount a horse), but there is no evidence to support the link.  Sent to recover at the Gloucester spa, she was treated – in the absence of symptoms supporting another diagnosis – for a spinal problem. Though this illness continued for the rest of her life, it is believed to be unrelated to the lung disease which she developed in 1837.She began to take opiates for the pain, laudanum (an opium concoction) followed by morphine, then commonly prescribed. She would become dependent on them for much of her adulthood; the use from an early age may well have contributed to her frail health. Biographers such as Alethea Hayter have suggested this may also have contributed to the wild vividness of her imagination and the poetry that it produced.By 1821 she had read Mary Wollstonecraft\\'s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), and become a passionate supporter of Wollstonecraft\\'s ideas. The child\\'s intellectual fascination with the classics and metaphysics was reflected in a religious intensity which she later described as \"not the deep persuasion of the mild Christian but the wild visions of an enthusiast.\" The Barretts attended services at the nearest Dissenting chapel, and Edward was active in Bible and Missionary societies.\\n\\nElizabeth\\'s mother died in 1828, and is buried at St Michael\\'s Church, Ledbury, next to her daughter Mary. Sarah Graham-Clarke, Elizabeth\\'s aunt, helped to care for the children, and she had clashes with Elizabeth\\'s strong will. In 1831 Elizabeth\\'s grandmother, Elizabeth Moulton, died. Following lawsuits and the abolition of slavery Mr Barrett incurred great financial and investment losses that forced him to sell Hope End. Although the family was never poor, the place was seized and put up for sale to satisfy creditors. Always secret in his financial dealings, he would not discuss his situation and the family was haunted by the idea that they might have to move to Jamaica.\\nBetween 1833 and 1835, she was living, with her family, at Belle Vue in Sidmouth. The site has now been renamed Cedar Shade and redeveloped. A blue plaque at the entrance to the site attests to this. In 1838, some years after the sale of Hope End, the family settled at 50 Wimpole Street.During 1837–38 the poet was struck with illness again, with symptoms today suggesting tuberculous ulceration of the lungs. That same year, at her physician\\'s insistence, she moved from London to Torquay, on the Devonshire coast.  Two tragedies then struck. In February 1840 her brother Samuel died of a fever in Jamaica.  Then her favourite brother Edward (\"Bro\") was drowned in a sailing accident in Torquay in July. This had a serious effect on her already fragile health. She felt guilty as her father had disapproved of Edward\\'s trip to Torquay. She wrote to Mitford, \"That was a very near escape from madness, absolute hopeless madness\". The family returned to Wimpole Street in 1841.\\n\\n\\n=== Success ===\\n\\nAt Wimpole Street Barrett Browning spent most of her time in her upstairs room. Her health began to improve, though she saw few people other than her immediate family. One of those was Kenyon, a wealthy friend of the family and patron of the arts. She received comfort from a spaniel named Flush, a gift from Mary Mitford. (Virginia Woolf later fictionalised the life of the dog, making him the protagonist of her 1933 novel Flush: A Biography).\\nBetween 1841 and 1844 Barrett Browning was prolific in poetry, translation and prose. The poem \"The Cry of the Children\", published in 1842 in Blackwoods, condemned child labour and helped bring about child-labour reforms by raising support for Lord Shaftesbury\\'s Ten Hours Bill (1844). At about the same time, she contributed critical prose pieces to Richard Henry Horne\\'s A New Spirit of the Age.\\nIn 1844 she published two volumes of Poems, which included \"A Drama of Exile\", \"A Vision of Poets\", and \"Lady Geraldine\\'s Courtship\" and two substantial critical essays for 1842 issues of The Athenaeum. \"Since she was not burdened with any domestic duties expected of her sisters, Barrett Browning could now devote herself entirely to the life of the mind, cultivating an enormous correspondence, reading widely\". Her prolific output made her a rival to Tennyson as a candidate for poet laureate in 1850 on the death of Wordsworth.A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque now commemorates Elizabeth at 50 Wimpole Street.\\n\\n\\n=== Robert Browning and Italy ===\\n\\nHer 1844 volume Poems made her one of the most popular writers in the country, and inspired Robert Browning to write to her.  He wrote, \"I love your verses with all my heart, dear Miss Barrett,\" praising their \"fresh strange music, the affluent language, the exquisite pathos and true new brave thought.\"Kenyon arranged for Browning to meet Elizabeth on 20 May 1845, in her rooms, and so began one of the most famous courtships in literature. Elizabeth had already produced a large amount of work, but Browning had a great influence on her subsequent writing, as did she on his: two of Barrett\\'s most famous pieces were written after she met Browning, Sonnets from the Portuguese and Aurora Leigh. Robert\\'s Men and Women is also a product of that time.\\nSome critics state that her activity was, in some ways, in decay before she met Browning: \"Until her relationship with Robert Browning began in 1845, Barrett\\'s willingness to engage in public discourse about social issues and about aesthetic issues in poetry, which had been so strong in her youth, gradually diminished, as did her physical health. As an intellectual presence and a physical being, she was becoming a shadow of herself.\"\\n\\nThe courtship and marriage between Robert Browning and Elizabeth were carried out secretly, as she knew her father would disapprove. After a private marriage at St Marylebone Parish Church, they honeymooned in Paris before moving to Italy, in September 1846, which became their home almost continuously until her death. Elizabeth\\'s loyal nurse, Wilson, who witnessed the marriage, accompanied the couple to Italy.Mr Barrett disinherited Elizabeth, as he did each of his children who married. Elizabeth had foreseen her father\\'s anger but had not anticipated her brothers\\' rejection. As Elizabeth had some money of her own, the couple were reasonably comfortable in Italy. The Brownings were well respected, and even famous. Elizabeth grew stronger and in 1849, at the age of 43, between four miscarriages, she gave birth to a son, Robert Wiedeman Barrett Browning, whom they called Pen. Their son later married, but had no legitimate children.\\nAt her husband\\'s insistence, Elizabeth\\'s second edition of Poems included her love sonnets; as a result, her popularity increased (as well as critical regard), and her artistic position was confirmed.\\nThe couple came to know a wide circle of artists and writers including William Makepeace Thackeray, sculptor Harriet Hosmer (who, she wrote, seemed to be the \"perfectly emancipated female\") and Harriet Beecher Stowe. In 1849 she met Margaret Fuller, and the female French novelist George Sand in 1852, whom she had long admired. Among her intimate friends in Florence was the writer Isa Blagden, whom she encouraged to write novels. They met Alfred Tennyson in Paris, and John Forster, Samuel Rogers and the Carlyles in London, later befriending Charles Kingsley and John Ruskin.\\n\\n\\n=== Decline and death ===\\n\\nAfter the death of an old friend, G. B. Hunter, and then of her father, Barrett Browning\\'s health started to deteriorate. The Brownings moved from Florence to Siena, residing at the Villa Alberti. Engrossed in Italian politics, she issued a small volume of political poems titled Poems before Congress (1860) \"most of which were written to express her sympathy with the Italian cause after the outbreak of fighting in 1859\". They caused a furore in England, and the conservative magazines Blackwood\\'s and the Saturday Review labelled her a fanatic. She dedicated this book to her husband. Her last work was A Musical Instrument, published posthumously.\\nBarrett Browning\\'s sister Henrietta died in November 1860. The couple spent the winter of 1860–61 in Rome where Barrett Browning\\'s health further deteriorated and they returned to Florence in early June 1861. She became gradually weaker, using morphine to ease her pain. She died on 29 June 1861 in her husband\\'s arms. Browning said that she died \"smilingly, happily, and with a face like a girl\\'s.... Her last word was... \\'\\'Beautiful\". She was buried in the Protestant English Cemetery of Florence. \"On Monday July 1 the shops in the area around Casa Guidi were closed, while Elizabeth was mourned with unusual demonstrations.\" The nature of her illness is still unclear. Some modern scientists speculate her illness may have been hypokalemic periodic paralysis, a genetic disorder that causes weakness and many of the other symptoms she described.\\n\\n\\n=== Publications ===\\n\\nBarrett Browning\\'s first known poem was written at the age of six or eight, \"On the Cruelty of Forcement to Man\". The manuscript, which protests against impressment, is currently in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library; the exact date is controversial because the \"2\" in the date 1812 is written over something else that is scratched out.Her first independent publication was \"Stanzas Excited by Reflections on the Present State of Greece\" in The New Monthly Magazine of May 1821; followed two months later by \"Thoughts Awakened by Contemplating a Piece of the Palm which Grows on the Summit of the Acropolis at Athens\".Her first collection of poems, An Essay on Mind, with Other Poems, was published in 1826 and reflected her passion for Byron and Greek politics. Its publication drew the attention of a blind scholar of the Greek language, Hugh Stuart Boyd, and of another Greek scholar, Uvedale Price, with whom she maintained sustained correspondence. Among other neighbours was Mrs James Martin from Colwall, with whom she also corresponded throughout her life. Later, at Boyd\\'s suggestion, she translated Aeschylus\\' Prometheus Bound (published in 1833; retranslated in 1850). During their friendship Barrett studied Greek literature, including Homer, Pindar and Aristophanes.\\nElizabeth opposed slavery and published two poems highlighting the barbarity of slavers and her support for the abolitionist cause: \"The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim\\'s Point\"; and \"A Curse for a Nation\". In \"Runaway\" she describes a slave woman who is whipped, raped, and made pregnant as she curses the slavers. Elizabeth declared herself glad that the slaves were \"virtually free\" when the Emancipation Act abolishing slavery in British colonies was passed in 1833, despite the fact that her father believed that Abolitionism would ruin his business.\\nThe date of publication of these poems is in dispute, but her position on slavery in the poems is clear and may have led to a rift between Elizabeth and her father. She wrote to John Ruskin in 1855 \"I belong to a family of West Indian slaveholders, and if I believed in curses, I should be afraid\". After the Jamaican slave uprising of 1831–32, her father and uncle continued to treat the slaves humanely.\\nIn London, John Kenyon, a distant cousin, introduced Elizabeth to literary figures including William Wordsworth, Mary Russell Mitford, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Alfred Tennyson and Thomas Carlyle. Elizabeth continued to write, contributing \"The Romaunt of Margaret\", \"The Romaunt of the Page\", \"The Poet\\'s Vow\" and other pieces to various periodicals. She corresponded with other writers, including Mary Russell Mitford, who would become a close friend and who would support Elizabeth\\'s literary ambitions.In 1838 The Seraphim and Other Poems appeared, the first volume of Elizabeth\\'s mature poetry to appear under her own name.\\nSonnets from the Portuguese was published in 1850. There is debate about the origin of the title. Some say it refers to the series of sonnets of the 16th-century Portuguese poet Luís de Camões. However, \"my little Portuguese\" was a pet name that Browning had adopted for Elizabeth and this may have some connection.The verse-novel Aurora Leigh, her most ambitious and perhaps the most popular of her longer poems, appeared in 1856. It is the story of a female writer making her way in life, balancing work and love, and based on Elizabeth\\'s own experiences. Aurora Leigh was an important influence on Susan B. Anthony\\'s thinking about the traditional roles of women, with regard to marriage versus independent individuality. The North American Review praised Elizabeth\\'s poem: \"Mrs. Browning\\'s poems are, in all respects, the utterance of a woman — of a woman of great learning, rich experience, and powerful genius, uniting to her woman\\'s nature the strength which is sometimes thought peculiar to a man.\"\\n\\n\\n== Spiritual influence ==\\nMuch of Barrett Browning\\'s work carries a religious theme. She had read and studied such works as Milton\\'s Paradise Lost and Dante\\'s Inferno. She says in her writing, \"We want the sense of the saturation of Christ\\'s blood upon the souls of our poets, that it may cry through them in answer to the ceaseless wail of the Sphinx of our humanity, expounding agony into renovation. Something of this has been perceived in art when its glory was at the fullest. Something of a yearning after this may be seen among the Greek Christian poets, something which would have been much with a stronger faculty\". She believed that \"Christ\\'s religion is essentially poetry – poetry glorified\". She explored the religious aspect in many of her poems, especially in her early work, such as the sonnets.\\nShe was interested in theological debate, had learned Hebrew and read the Hebrew Bible. Her seminal Aurora Leigh, for example, features religious imagery and allusion to the apocalypse. The critic Cynthia Scheinberg notes that female characters in Aurora Leigh and her earlier work \"The Virgin Mary to the Child Jesus\" allude to the female character Miriam from the Hebrew Bible. These allusions to Miriam in both poems mirror the way in which Barrett Browning herself drew from Jewish history, while distancing herself from it, in order to maintain the public appearance of a Christian woman poet of the Victorian Age.In the correspondence Barrett Browning kept with the Reverend William Merry from 1843 to 1844 on predestination and salvation by works, she identifies herself as a Congregationalist: \"I am not a Baptist — but a Congregational Christian, — in the holding of my private opinions.\"\\n\\n\\n== Barrett Browning Institute ==\\nIn 1892, Ledbury, Herefordshire, held a design competition to build an Institute in honour of Barrett Browning. Brightwen Binyon beat 44 other designs. It was based on the timber-framed Market House, which was opposite the site. It was completed in 1896. However, Nikolaus Pevsner was not impressed by its style. In 1938, it became a public library. It has been Grade II-listed since 2007.\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\n\\nBarrett Browning was widely popular in the United Kingdom and the United States during her lifetime. Edgar Allan Poe was inspired by her poem Lady Geraldine\\'s Courtship and specifically borrowed the poem\\'s metre for his poem The Raven. Poe had reviewed Barrett Browning\\'s work in the January 1845 issue of the Broadway Journal, saying that \"her poetic inspiration is the highest – we can conceive of nothing more august. Her sense of Art is pure in itself.\" In return, she praised The Raven, and Poe dedicated his 1845 collection The Raven and Other Poems to her, referring to her as \"the noblest of her sex\".Barrett Browning\\'s poetry greatly influenced Emily Dickinson, who admired her as a woman of achievement. Her popularity in the United States and Britain was further advanced by her stands against social injustice, including slavery in the United States, injustice toward Italian citizens by foreign rulers, and child labour.\\nLilian Whiting published a biography of Barrett Browning (1899) which describes her as \"the most philosophical poet\" and depicts her life as \"a Gospel of applied Christianity\". To Whiting, the term \"art for art\\'s sake\" did not apply to Barrett Browning\\'s work, as each poem, distinctively purposeful, was borne of a more \"honest vision\". In this critical analysis, Whiting portrays Barrett Browning as a poet who uses knowledge of Classical literature with an \"intuitive gift of spiritual divination\". In Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Angela Leighton suggests that the portrayal of Barrett Browning as the \"pious iconography of womanhood\" has distracted us from her poetic achievements. Leighton cites the 1931 play by Rudolf Besier, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, as evidence that 20th-century literary criticism of Barrett Browning\\'s work has suffered more as a result of her popularity than poetic ineptitude. The play was popularized by actress Katharine Cornell, for whom it became a signature role. It was an enormous success, both artistically and commercially, and was revived several times and adapted twice into movies.\\nThroughout the 20th century, literary criticism of Barrett Browning\\'s poetry remained sparse until her poems were discovered by the women\\'s movement. She once described herself as being inclined to reject several women\\'s rights principles, suggesting in letters to Mary Russell Mitford and her husband that she believed that there was an inferiority of intellect in women. In Aurora Leigh, however, she created a strong and independent woman who embraces both work and love. Leighton writes that because Elizabeth participates in the literary world, where voice and diction are dominated by perceived masculine superiority, she \"is defined only in mysterious opposition to everything that distinguishes the male subject who writes...\" A five-volume scholarly edition of her works was published in 2010, the first in over a century.\\n\\n\\n== Works (collections) ==\\n1820: The Battle of Marathon: A Poem.

       " {'Title': 'Rudyard Kipling',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'Joseph Rudyard Kipling ( RUD-yərd; 30 December 1865 – 18 January 1936) was an English journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist. He was born in India, which inspired much of his work.\\nKipling\\'s works of fiction include The Jungle Book (1894), Kim (1901), and many short stories, including \"The Man Who Would Be King\" (1888). His poems include \"Mandalay\" (1890), \"Gunga Din\" (1890), \"The Gods of the Copybook Headings\" (1919), \"The White Man\\'s Burden\" (1899), and \"If—\" (1910). He is seen as an innovator in the art of the short story. His children\\'s books are classics; one critic noted \"a versatile and luminous narrative gift.\" Kipling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was among the United Kingdom\\'s most popular writers. Henry James said, \"Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius, as distinct from fine intelligence, that I have ever known.\" In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, as the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and at 41, its youngest recipient to date. He was also sounded for the British Poet Laureateship and several times for a knighthood, but declined both. Following his death in 1936, his ashes were interred at Poets\\' Corner, part of the South Transept of Westminster Abbey.\\nKipling\\'s subsequent reputation has changed with the political and social climate of the age. The contrasting views of him continued for much of the 20th century. George Orwell saw Kipling as \"a jingo imperialist,\"  who was \"morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting.\"  Literary critic Douglas Kerr wrote: \"[Kipling] is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes, he is recognised as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced. That, and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts, make him a force to be reckoned with.\"\\n\\n\\n== Childhood (1865–1882) ==\\n\\nRudyard Kipling was born on 30 December 1865 in Bombay, in the Bombay Presidency of British India, to Alice Kipling (née MacDonald) and John Lockwood Kipling. Alice (one of the four noted MacDonald sisters) was a vivacious woman, of whom Lord Dufferin would say, \"Dullness and Mrs Kipling cannot exist in the same room.\" John Lockwood Kipling, a sculptor and pottery designer, was the Principal and Professor of Architectural Sculpture at the newly founded Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art in Bombay.John Lockwood and Alice had met in 1863 and courted at Rudyard Lake in Rudyard, Staffordshire, England. They married and moved to India in 1865. They had been so moved by the beauty of the Rudyard Lake area that they named their first child after it. Two of Alice\\'s sisters were married to artists: Georgiana to the painter Edward Burne-Jones, and her sister Agnes to Edward Poynter. Kipling\\'s most prominent relative was his first cousin, Stanley Baldwin, who was Conservative Prime Minister three times in the 1920s and 1930s.Kipling\\'s birth home on the campus of the J. J. School of Art in Bombay was for many years used as the Dean\\'s residence. Although a cottage bears a plaque noting it as his birth site, the original one may have been torn down and replaced decades ago. Some historians and conservationists take the view that the bungalow marks a site merely close to the home of Kipling\\'s birth, as it was built in 1882 – about 15 years after Kipling was born. Kipling seems to have said as much to the Dean when visiting J. J. School in the 1930s.\\n\\nKipling wrote of Bombay:\\n\\nAccording to Bernice M. Murphy, \"Kipling\\'s parents considered themselves \\'Anglo-Indians\\' [a term used in the 19th century for people of British origin living in India] and so too would their son, though he spent the bulk of his life elsewhere. Complex issues of identity and national allegiance would become prominent in his fiction.\"Kipling referred to such conflicts. For example: \"In the afternoon heats before we took our sleep, she (the Portuguese ayah, or nanny) or Meeta (the Hindu bearer, or male attendant) would tell us stories and Indian nursery songs all unforgotten, and we were sent into the dining-room after we had been dressed, with the caution \\'Speak English now to Papa and Mamma.\\' So one spoke \\'English\\', haltingly translated out of the vernacular idiom that one thought and dreamed in.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Education in Britain ===\\n\\nKipling\\'s days of \"strong light and darkness\" in Bombay ended when he was five. As was the custom in British India, he and his three-year-old sister Alice (\"Trix\") were taken to the United Kingdom – in their case to Southsea, Portsmouth – to live with a couple who boarded children of British nationals living abroad. For the next six years (from October 1871 to April 1877), the children lived with the couple – Captain Pryse Agar Holloway, once an officer in the merchant navy, and Sarah Holloway – at their house, Lorne Lodge, 4 Campbell Road, Southsea.In his autobiography published 65 years later, Kipling recalled the stay with horror, and wondered if the combination of cruelty and neglect which he experienced there at the hands of Mrs Holloway might not have hastened the onset of his literary life: \"If you cross-examine a child of seven or eight on his day\\'s doings (specially when he wants to go to sleep) he will contradict himself very satisfactorily. If each contradiction be set down as a lie and retailed at breakfast, life is not easy. I have known a certain amount of bullying, but this was calculated torture – religious as well as scientific. Yet it made me give attention to the lies I soon found it necessary to tell: and this, I presume, is the foundation of literary effort.\" \\n\\nTrix fared better at Lorne Lodge; Mrs Holloway apparently hoped that Trix would eventually marry the Holloways\\' son. The two Kipling children, however, had no relatives in England they could visit, except that they spent a month each Christmas with a maternal aunt Georgiana (\"Georgy\") and her husband, Edward Burne-Jones, at their house, The Grange, in Fulham, London, which Kipling called \"a paradise which I verily believe saved me.\"In the spring of 1877, Alice returned from India and removed the children from Lorne Lodge. Kipling remembers, \"Often and often afterwards, the beloved Aunt would ask me why I had never told any one how I was being treated. Children tell little more than animals, for what comes to them they accept as eternally established. Also, badly-treated children have a clear notion of what they are likely to get if they betray the secrets of a prison-house before they are clear of it.\"Alice took the children during Spring 1877 to Goldings Farm at Loughton, where a carefree summer and autumn was spent on the farm and adjoining Forest, some of the time with Stanley Baldwin. In January 1878, Kipling was admitted to the United Services College at Westward Ho!, Devon, a school recently founded to prepare boys for the army. It proved rough going for him at first, but later led to firm friendships and provided the setting for his schoolboy stories Stalky & Co. (1899). While there, Kipling met and fell in love with Florence Garrard, who was boarding with Trix at Southsea (to which Trix had returned}. Florence became the model for Maisie in Kipling\\'s first novel, The Light That Failed (1891).\\n\\n\\n=== Return to India ===\\nNear the end of his schooling, it was decided that Kipling did not have the academic ability to get into Oxford University on a scholarship. His parents lacked the wherewithal to finance him, and so Kipling\\'s father obtained him a job in Lahore, where the father served as Principal of the Mayo College of Art and Curator of the Lahore Museum. Kipling was to be assistant editor of a local newspaper, the Civil and Military Gazette.\\nHe sailed for India on 20 September 1882 and arrived in Bombay on 18 October. He described the moment years later: \"So, at sixteen years and nine months, but looking four or five years older, and adorned with real whiskers which the scandalised Mother abolished within one hour of beholding, I found myself at Bombay where I was born, moving among sights and smells that made me deliver in the vernacular sentences whose meaning I knew not. Other Indian-born boys have told me how the same thing happened to them.\" This arrival changed Kipling, as he explains: \"There were yet three or four days\\' rail to Lahore, where my people lived. After these, my English years fell away, nor ever, I think, came back in full strength.\" \\n\\n\\n== Early adult life (1882–1914) ==\\nFrom 1883 to 1889, Kipling worked in British India for local newspapers such as the Civil and Military Gazette in Lahore and The Pioneer in Allahabad.\\n\\nThe former, which was the newspaper Kipling was to call his \"mistress and most true love,\"  appeared six days a week throughout the year, except for one-day breaks for Christmas and Easter. Stephen Wheeler, the editor, worked Kipling hard, but Kipling\\'s need to write was unstoppable. In 1886, he published his first collection of verse, Departmental Ditties. That year also brought a change of editors at the newspaper; Kay Robinson, the new editor, allowed more creative freedom and Kipling was asked to contribute short stories to the newspaper.In an article printed in the Chums boys\\' annual, an ex-colleague of Kipling\\'s stated that \"he never knew such a fellow for ink – he simply revelled in it, filling up his pen viciously, and then throwing the contents all over the office, so that it was almost dangerous to approach him.\" The anecdote continues: \"In the hot weather when he (Kipling) wore only white trousers and a thin vest, he is said to have resembled a Dalmatian dog more than a human being, for he was spotted all over with ink in every direction.\"\\nIn the summer of 1883, Kipling visited Shimla, then Simla, a well-known hill station and the summer capital of British India. By then it was the practice for the Viceroy of India and government to move to Simla for six months, and the town became a \"centre of power as well as pleasure.\"  Kipling\\'s family became annual visitors to Simla, and Lockwood Kipling was asked to serve in Christ Church there. Rudyard Kipling returned to Simla for his annual leave each year from 1885 to 1888, and the town featured prominently in many stories he wrote for the Gazette. \"My month\\'s leave at Simla, or whatever Hill Station my people went to, was pure joy – every golden hour counted. It began in heat and discomfort, by rail and road. It ended in the cool evening, with a wood fire in one\\'s bedroom, and next morn – thirty more of them ahead! – the early cup of tea, the Mother who brought it in, and the long talks of us all together again. One had leisure to work, too, at whatever play-work was in one\\'s head, and that was usually full.\"Back in Lahore, 39 of his stories appeared in the Gazette between November 1886 and June 1887. Kipling included most of them in Plain Tales from the Hills, his first prose collection, published in Calcutta in January 1888, a month after his 22nd birthday. Kipling\\'s time in Lahore, however, had come to an end. In November 1887, he was moved to the Gazette\\'s larger sister newspaper, The Pioneer, in Allahabad in the United Provinces, where worked as assistant editor and lived in Belvedere House from 1888 to 1889.\\n\\nKipling\\'s writing continued at a frenetic pace. In 1888, he published six collections of short stories: Soldiers Three, The Story of the Gadsbys, In Black and White, Under the Deodars, The Phantom Rickshaw, and Wee Willie Winkie. These contain a total of 41 stories, some quite long. In addition, as The Pioneer\\'s special correspondent in the western region of Rajputana, he wrote many sketches that were later collected in Letters of Marque and published in From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel.Kipling was discharged from The Pioneer in early 1889 after a dispute. By this time, he had been increasingly thinking of his future. He sold the rights to his six volumes of stories for £200 and a small royalty, and the Plain Tales for £50; in addition, he received six-months\\' salary from The Pioneer, in lieu of notice.\\n\\n\\n=== Return to London ===\\nKipling decided to use the money to move to London, as the literary centre of the British Empire. On 9 March 1889, he left India, travelling first to San Francisco via Rangoon, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. Kipling was favourably impressed by Japan, calling its people \"gracious folk and fair manners.\" Kipling later wrote that he \"had lost his heart\" to a geisha whom he called O-Toyo, writing while in the United States during the same trip across the Pacific, \"I had left the innocent East far behind.... Weeping softly for O-Toyo.... O-Toyo was a darling.\" Kipling then travelled through the United States, writing articles for The Pioneer that were later published in From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel.Starting his North American travels in San Francisco, Kipling went north to Portland, Oregon, then Seattle, Washington, up to Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia, through Medicine Hat, Alberta, back into the US to Yellowstone National Park, down to Salt Lake City, then east to Omaha, Nebraska and on to Chicago, Illinois, then to Beaver, Pennsylvania on the Ohio River to visit the Hill family. From there, he went to Chautauqua with Professor Hill, and later to Niagara Falls, Toronto, Washington, D.C., New York, and Boston.In the course of this journey he met Mark Twain in Elmira, New York, and was deeply impressed. Kipling arrived unannounced at Twain\\'s home, and later wrote that as he rang the doorbell, \"It occurred to me for the first time that Mark Twain might possibly have other engagements other than the entertainment of escaped lunatics from India, be they ever so full of admiration.\"\\n\\nAs it was, Twain gladly welcomed Kipling and had a two-hour conversation with him on trends in Anglo-American literature and about what Twain was going to write in a sequel to Tom Sawyer, with Twain assuring Kipling that a sequel was coming, although he had not decided upon the ending: either Sawyer would be elected to Congress or he would be hanged. Twain also passed along the literary advice that an author should \"get your facts first and then you can distort \\'em as much as you please.\" Twain, who rather liked Kipling, later wrote of their meeting: \"Between us, we cover all knowledge; he covers all that can be known and I cover the rest.\" Kipling then crossed the Atlantic to Liverpool in October 1889. He soon made his début in the London literary world, to great acclaim.\\n\\n\\n=== London ===\\nIn London, Kipling had several stories accepted by magazines. He found a place to live for the next two years at Villiers Street, near Charing Cross (in a building subsequently named Kipling House):\\n\\nMeantime, I had found me quarters in Villiers Street, Strand, which forty-six years ago was primitive and passionate in its habits and population. My rooms were small, not over-clean or well-kept, but from my desk I could look out of my window through the fanlight of Gatti\\'s Music-Hall entrance, across the street, almost on to its stage. The Charing Cross trains rumbled through my dreams on one side, the boom of the Strand on the other, while, before my windows, Father Thames under the Shot tower walked up and down with his traffic.\\nIn the next two years, he published a novel, The Light That Failed, had a nervous breakdown, and met an American writer and publishing agent, Wolcott Balestier, with whom he collaborated on a novel, The Naulahka (a title which he uncharacteristically misspelt; see below). In 1891, as advised his doctors, Kipling took another sea voyage, to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and once again India. He cut short his plans to spend Christmas with his family in India when he heard of Balestier\\'s sudden death from typhoid fever and decided to return to London immediately. Before his return, he had used the telegram to propose to and be accepted by Wolcott\\'s sister Caroline Starr Balestier (1862–1939), called \"Carrie,\"  whom he had met a year earlier, and with whom he had apparently been having an intermittent romance. Meanwhile, late in 1891, a collection of his short stories on the British in India, Life\\'s Handicap, was published in London.On 18 January 1892, Carrie Balestier (aged 29) and Rudyard Kipling (aged 26) married in London, in the \"thick of an influenza epidemic, when the undertakers had run out of black horses and the dead had to be content with brown ones.\" The wedding was held at All Souls Church, Langham Place. Henry James gave the bride away.\\n\\n\\n=== United States ===\\n\\nKipling and his wife settled upon a honeymoon that took them first to the United States (including a stop at the Balestier family estate near Brattleboro, Vermont) and then to Japan. On arriving in Yokohama, they discovered that their bank, The New Oriental Banking Corporation, had failed. Taking this loss in their stride, they returned to the US, back to Vermont – Carrie by this time was pregnant with their first child – and rented a small cottage on a farm near Brattleboro for $10 a month. According to Kipling, \"We furnished it with a simplicity that fore-ran the hire-purchase system. We bought, second or third hand, a huge, hot-air stove which we installed in the cellar. We cut generous holes in our thin floors for its eight-inch [20 cm] tin pipes (why we were not burned in our beds each week of the winter I never can understand) and we were extraordinarily and self-centredly content.\"In this house, which they called Bliss Cottage, their first child, Josephine, was born \"in three-foot of snow on the night of 29 December 1892. Her Mother\\'s birthday being the 31st and mine the 30th of the same month, we congratulated her on her sense of the fitness of things....\"\\n\\nIt was also in this cottage that the first dawnings of The Jungle Books came to Kipling: \"The workroom in the Bliss Cottage was seven feet by eight, and from December to April, the snow lay level with its window-sill. It chanced that I had written a tale about Indian Forestry work which included a boy who had been brought up by wolves. In the stillness, and suspense, of the winter of \\'92 some memory of the Masonic Lions of my childhood\\'s magazine, and a phrase in Haggard\\'s Nada the Lily, combined with the echo of this tale. After blocking out the main idea in my head, the pen took charge, and I watched it begin to write stories about Mowgli and animals, which later grew into the two Jungle Books.\"With Josephine\\'s arrival, Bliss Cottage was felt to be congested, so eventually the couple bought land – 10 acres (4.0 ha) on a rocky hillside overlooking the Connecticut River – from Carrie\\'s brother Beatty Balestier and built their own house. Kipling named this Naulakha, in honour of Wolcott and of their collaboration, and this time the name was spelt correctly. From his early years in Lahore (1882–87), Kipling had become enamoured with the Mughal architecture, especially the Naulakha pavilion situated in Lahore Fort, which eventually inspired the title of his novel as well as the house. The house still stands on Kipling Road, three miles (5 km) north of Brattleboro in Dummerston, Vermont: a big, secluded, dark-green house, with shingled roof and sides, which Kipling called his \"ship,\"  and which brought him \"sunshine and a mind at ease.\"  His seclusion in Vermont, combined with his healthy \"sane clean life,\"  made Kipling both inventive and prolific.\\nIn a mere four years he produced, along with the Jungle Books, a book of short stories (The Day\\'s Work), a novel (Captains Courageous), and a profusion of poetry, including the volume The Seven Seas. The collection of Barrack-Room Ballads was issued in March 1892, first published individually for the most part in 1890, and contained his poems \"Mandalay\" and \"Gunga Din.\"  He especially enjoyed writing the Jungle Books and also corresponding with many children who wrote to him about them.\\n\\n\\n==== Life in New England ====\\n\\nThe writing life in Naulakha was occasionally interrupted by visitors, including his father, who visited soon after his retirement in 1893, and the British writer Arthur Conan Doyle, who brought his golf clubs, stayed for two days, and gave Kipling an extended golf lesson. Kipling seemed to take to golf, occasionally practising with the local Congregational minister and even playing with red-painted balls when the ground was covered in snow. However, winter golf was \"not altogether a success because there were no limits to a drive; the ball might skid two miles (3 km) down the long slope to Connecticut river.\" Kipling loved the outdoors, not least of whose marvels in Vermont was the turning of the leaves each fall. He described this moment in a letter: \"A little maple began it, flaming blood-red of a sudden where he stood against the dark green of a pine-belt. Next morning there was an answering signal from the swamp where the sumacs grow. Three days later, the hill-sides as fast as the eye could range were afire, and the roads paved, with crimson and gold. Then a wet wind blew, and ruined all the uniforms of that gorgeous army; and the oaks, who had held themselves in reserve, buckled on their dull and bronzed cuirasses and stood it out stiffly to the last blown leaf, till nothing remained but pencil-shadings of bare boughs, and one could see into the most private heart of the woods.\"\\n\\nIn February 1896, Elsie Kipling was born, the couple\\'s second daughter. By this time, according to several biographers, their marital relationship was no longer light-hearted and spontaneous. Although they would always remain loyal to each other, they seemed now to have fallen into set roles. In a letter to a friend who had become engaged around this time, the 30‑year‑old Kipling offered this sombre counsel: marriage principally taught \"the tougher virtues – such as humility, restraint, order, and forethought.\"The Kiplings loved life in Vermont and might have lived out their lives there, were it not for two incidents – one of global politics, the other of family discord. By the early 1890s, the United Kingdom and Venezuela were in a border dispute involving British Guiana. The US had made several offers to arbitrate, but in 1895, the new American Secretary of State Richard Olney upped the ante by arguing for the American \"right\" to arbitrate on grounds of sovereignty on the continent (see the Olney interpretation as an extension of the Monroe Doctrine). This raised hackles in Britain, and the situation grew into a major Anglo-American crisis, with talk of war on both sides.\\nAlthough the crisis eased into greater US–British cooperation, Kipling was bewildered by what he felt was persistent anti-British sentiment in the US, especially in the press. He wrote in a letter that it felt like being \"aimed at with a decanter across a friendly dinner table.\" By January 1896, he had decided to end his family\\'s \"good wholesome life\" in the US and seek their fortunes elsewhere.\\nA family dispute became the final straw. For some time, relations between Carrie and her brother Beatty Balestier had been strained, owing to his drinking and insolvency. In May 1896, an inebriated Beatty encountered Kipling on the street and threatened him with physical harm. The incident led to Beatty\\'s eventual arrest, but in the subsequent hearing and the resulting publicity, Kipling\\'s privacy was destroyed, and he was left feeling miserable and exhausted. In July 1896, a week before the hearing was to resume, the Kiplings packed their belongings, left the United States and returned to England.\\n\\n\\n=== Devon ===\\nBy September 1896, the Kiplings were in Torquay, Devon, on the south-western coast of England, in a hillside home overlooking the English Channel. Although Kipling did not much care for his new house, whose design, he claimed, left its occupants feeling dispirited and gloomy, he managed to remain productive and socially active.Kipling was now a famous man, and in the previous two or three years had increasingly been making political pronouncements in his writings. The Kiplings had welcomed their first son, John, in August 1897. Kipling had begun work on two poems, \"Recessional\" (1897) and \"The White Man\\'s Burden\" (1899), which were to create controversy when published. Regarded by some as anthems for enlightened and duty-bound empire-building (capturing the mood of the Victorian era), the poems were seen by others as propaganda for brazen-faced imperialism and its attendant racial attitudes; still others saw irony in the poems and warnings of the perils of empire.\\n\\nThere was also foreboding in the poems, a sense that all could yet come to naught.\\n\\nA prolific writer during his time in Torquay, he also wrote Stalky & Co., a collection of school stories (born of his experience at the United Services College in Westward Ho!), whose juvenile protagonists display a know-it-all, cynical outlook on patriotism and authority. According to his family, Kipling enjoyed reading aloud stories from Stalky & Co. to them and often went into spasms of laughter over his own jokes.\\n\\n\\n=== Visits to South Africa ===\\n\\nIn early 1898, the Kiplings travelled to South Africa for their winter holiday, so beginning an annual tradition which (except the following year) would last until 1908. They would stay in \"The Woolsack,\"  a house on Cecil Rhodes\\'s estate at Groote Schuur (now a student residence for the University of Cape Town), within walking distance of Rhodes\\' mansion.With his new reputation as Poet of the Empire, Kipling was warmly received by some of the influential politicians of the Cape Colony, including Rhodes, Sir Alfred Milner, and Leander Starr Jameson. Kipling cultivated their friendship and came to admire the men and their politics. The period 1898–1910 was crucial in the history of South Africa and included the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the ensuing peace treaty, and the 1910 formation of the Union of South Africa. Back in England, Kipling wrote poetry in support of the British cause in the Boer War and on his next visit to South Africa in early 1900, became a correspondent for The Friend newspaper in Bloemfontein, which had been commandeered by Lord Roberts for British troops.Although his journalistic stint was to last only two weeks, it was Kipling\\'s first work on a newspaper staff since he left The Pioneer in Allahabad more than ten years before. At The Friend, he made lifelong friendships with Perceval Landon, H. A. Gwynne, and others. He also wrote articles published more widely expressing his views on the conflict. Kipling penned an inscription for the Honoured Dead Memorial (Siege memorial) in Kimberley.\\n\\n\\n=== Sussex ===\\n\\nIn 1897, Kipling moved from Torquay to Rottingdean, East Sussex – first to North End House and then to The Elms. In 1902, Kipling bought Bateman\\'s, a house built in 1634 and located in rural Burwash.\\nBateman\\'s was Kipling\\'s home from 1902 until his death in 1936. The house and its surrounding buildings, the mill and 33 acres (13 ha), were bought for £9,300. It had no bathroom, no running water upstairs and no electricity, but Kipling loved it: \"Behold us, lawful owners of a grey stone lichened house – A.D. 1634 over the door – beamed, panelled, with old oak staircase, and all untouched and unfaked. It is a good and peaceable place. We have loved it ever since our first sight of it\" (from a November 1902 letter).In the non-fiction realm, he became involved in the debate over the British response to the rise in German naval power known as the Tirpitz Plan, to build a fleet to challenge the Royal Navy, publishing a series of articles in 1898 collected as A Fleet in Being. On a visit to the United States in 1899, Kipling and his daughter Josephine developed pneumonia, from which she eventually died.\\n\\nIn the wake of his daughter\\'s death, Kipling concentrated on collecting material for what became Just So Stories for Little Children, published in 1902, the year after Kim. The American literary scholar David Scott has argued that Kim disproves the claim by Edward Said about Kipling as a promoter of Orientalism as Kipling – who was deeply interested in Buddhism – as he presented Tibetan Buddhism in a fairly sympathetic light and aspects of the novel appeared to reflect a Buddhist understanding of the universe. Kipling was offended by the German Emperor Wilhelm II\\'s Hun speech (Hunnenrede) in 1900, urging German troops being sent to China to crush the Boxer Rebellion to behave like \"Huns\" and take no prisoners.In a 1902 poem, The Rowers, Kipling attacked the Kaiser as a threat to Britain and made the first use of the term \"Hun\" as an anti-German insult, using Wilhelm\\'s own words and the actions of German troops in China to portray Germans as essentially barbarian. In an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro, the Francophile Kipling called Germany a menace and called for an Anglo-French alliance to stop it. In another letter at the same time, Kipling described the \"unfrei peoples of Central Europe\" as living in \"the Middle Ages with machine guns.\" \\n\\n\\n==== Speculative fiction ====\\nKipling wrote a number of speculative fiction short stories, including \"The Army of a Dream,\"  in which he sought to show a more efficient and responsible army than the hereditary bureaucracy of England at the time, and two science fiction stories: \"With the Night Mail\" (1905) and \"As Easy As A.B.C.\" (1912). Both were set in the 21st century in Kipling\\'s Aerial Board of Control universe. They read like modern hard science fiction, and introduced the literary technique known as indirect exposition, which would later become one of science fiction writer Robert Heinlein\\'s hallmarks. This technique is one that Kipling picked up in India, and used to solve the problem of his English readers not understanding much about Indian society, when writing The Jungle Book.\\n\\n\\n==== Nobel laureate and beyond ====\\nIn 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, having been nominated in that year by Charles Oman, professor at the University of Oxford. The prize citation said it was \"in consideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration which characterize the creations of this world-famous author.\" Nobel prizes had been established in 1901 and Kipling was the first English-language recipient. At the award ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December 1907, the Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, Carl David af Wirsén, praised both Kipling and three centuries of English literature:\\n\\nThe Swedish Academy, in awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature this year to Rudyard Kipling, desires to pay a tribute of homage to the literature of England, so rich in manifold glories, and to the greatest genius in the realm of narrative that that country has produced in our times.\\nTo \"book-end\" this achievement came the publication of two connected poetry and story collections: Puck of Pook\\'s Hill (1906), and Rewards and Fairies (1910). The latter contained the poem \"If—.\"  In a 1995 BBC opinion poll, it was voted the UK\\'s favourite poem. This exhortation to self-control and stoicism is arguably Kipling\\'s most famous poem.\\n\\nSuch was Kipling\\'s popularity that he was asked by his friend Max Aitken to intervene in the 1911 Canadian election on behalf of the Conservatives. In 1911, the major issue in Canada was a reciprocity treaty with the United States signed by the Liberal Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier and vigorously opposed by the Conservatives under Sir Robert Borden. On 7 September 1911, the Montreal Daily Star newspaper published a front-page appeal against the agreement by Kipling, who wrote: \"It is her own soul that Canada risks today. Once that soul is pawned for any consideration, Canada must inevitably conform to the commercial, legal, financial, social, and ethical standards which will be imposed on her by the sheer admitted weight of the United States.\" At the time, the Montreal Daily Star was Canada\\'s most read newspaper. Over the next week, Kipling\\'s appeal was reprinted in every English newspaper in Canada and is credited with helping to turn Canadian public opinion against the Liberal government.Kipling sympathised with the anti-Home Rule stance of Irish Unionists, who opposed Irish autonomy. He was friends with Edward Carson, the Dublin-born leader of Ulster Unionism, who raised the Ulster Volunteers to prevent Home Rule in Ireland. Kipling wrote in a letter to a friend that Ireland was not a nation, and that before the English arrived in 1169, the Irish were a gang of cattle thieves living in savagery and killing each other while \"writing dreary poems\" about it all. In his view it was only British rule that allowed Ireland to advance. A visit to Ireland in 1911 confirmed Kipling\\'s prejudices. He wrote that the Irish countryside was beautiful, but spoiled by what he called the ugly homes of Irish farmers, with Kipling adding that God had made the Irish into poets having \"deprived them of love of line or knowledge of colour.\"  In contrast, Kipling had nothing but praise for the \"decent folk\" of the Protestant majority and Unionist Ulster.Kipling wrote the poem \"Ulster\" in 1912, reflecting his Unionist politics. Kipling often referred to the Irish Unionists as \"our party.\"  Kipling had no sympathy or understanding for Irish nationalism, seeing Home Rule as an act of treason by the government of the Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith that would plunge Ireland into the Dark Ages and allow the Irish Catholic majority to oppress the Protestant minority. The scholar David Gilmour wrote that Kipling\\'s lack of understanding of Ireland could be seen in his attack on John Redmond – the Anglophile leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party who wanted Home Rule because he believed it was the best way of keeping the United Kingdom together – as a traitor working to break up the United Kingdom. Ulster was first publicly read at an Unionist rally in Belfast, where the largest Union Jack ever made was unfolded. Kipling admitted it was meant to strike a \"hard blow\" against the Asquith government\\'s Home Rule bill: \"Rebellion, rapine, hate, Oppression, wrong and greed, Are loosed to rule our fate, By England\\'s act and deed.\"  Ulster generated much controversy with the Conservative MP Sir Mark Sykes – who as a Unionist was opposed to the Home Rule bill – condemning Ulster in The Morning Post as a \"direct appeal to ignorance and a deliberate attempt to foster religious hate.\" Kipling was a staunch opponent of Bolshevism, a position which he shared with his friend Henry Rider Haggard. The two had bonded on Kipling\\'s arrival in London in 1889 largely due to their shared opinions, and remained lifelong friends.\\n\\n\\n=== Freemasonry ===\\nAccording to the English magazine Masonic Illustrated, Kipling became a Freemason in about 1885, before the usual minimum age of 21, being initiated into Hope and Perseverance Lodge No. 782 in Lahore. He later wrote to The Times, \"I was Secretary for some years of the Lodge... which included Brethren of at least four creeds. I was entered [as an Apprentice] by a member from Brahmo Somaj, a Hindu, passed [to the degree of Fellow Craft] by a Mohammedan, and raised [to the degree of Master Mason] by an Englishman. Our Tyler was an Indian Jew.\" Kipling received not only the three degrees of Craft Masonry but also the side degrees of Mark Master Mason and Royal Ark Mariner.Kipling so loved his Masonic experience that he memorialised its ideals in his poem \"The Mother Lodge,\"  and used the fraternity and its symbols as vital plot devices in his novella The Man Who Would Be King.\\n\\n\\n== First World War (1914–18) ==\\nAt the beginning of the First World War, like many other writers, Kipling wrote pamphlets and poems enthusiastically supporting the UK war aims of restoring Belgium, after it had been occupied by Germany, together with generalised statements that Britain was standing up for the cause of good. In September 1914, Kipling was asked by the government to write propaganda, an offer that he accepted. Kipling\\'s pamphlets and stories were popular with the British people during the war, his major themes being to glorify the British military as the place for heroic men to be, while citing German atrocities against Belgian civilians and the stories of women brutalised by a horrific war unleashed by Germany, yet surviving and triumphing in spite of their suffering.Kipling was enraged by reports of the Rape of Belgium together with the sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915, which he saw as a deeply inhumane act, which led him to see the war as a crusade for civilisation against barbarism. In a 1915 speech, Kipling declared, \"There was no crime, no cruelty, no abomination that the mind of men can conceive of which the German has not perpetrated, is not perpetrating, and will not perpetrate if he is allowed to go on.... Today, there are only two divisions in the world... human beings and Germans.\"Alongside his passionate antipathy towards Germany, Kipling was privately deeply critical of how the war was being fought by the British Army, complaining as early as October 1914 that Germany should have been defeated by now, and something must be wrong with the British Army. Kipling, who was shocked by the heavy losses that the British Expeditionary Force had taken by the autumn of 1914, blamed the entire pre-war generation of British politicians who, he argued, had failed to learn the lessons of the Boer War. Thus thousands of British soldiers were now paying with their lives for their failure in the fields of France and Belgium.Kipling had scorn for men who shirked duty in the First World War. In \"The New Army in Training\" (1915), Kipling concluded by saying:\\n\\nThis much we can realise, even though we are so close to it, the old safe instinct saves us from triumph and exultation. But what will be the position in years to come of the young man who has deliberately elected to outcaste himself from this all-embracing brotherhood? What of his family, and, above all, what of his descendants, when the books have been closed and the last balance struck of sacrifice and sorrow in every hamlet, village, parish, suburb, city, shire, district, province, and Dominion throughout the Empire?\\nIn 1914, Kipling was one of fifty-three leading British authors — a number that included H. G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Thomas Hardy — who signed their names to the “Authors’ Declaration.” This manifesto declared that the German invasion of Belgium had been a brutal crime, and that Britain “could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war.”\\n\\n\\n=== Death of John Kipling ===\\n\\nKipling\\'s son John was killed in action at the Battle of Loos in September 1915, at age 18. John had initially wanted to join the Royal Navy, but having had his application turned down after a failed medical examination due to poor eyesight, he opted to apply for military service as an army officer. Again, his eyesight was an issue during the medical examination. In fact, he tried twice to enlist, but was rejected. His father had been lifelong friends with Lord Roberts, former commander-in-chief of the British Army, and colonel of the Irish Guards, and at Rudyard\\'s request, John was accepted into the Irish Guards.John Kipling was sent to Loos two days into the battle in a reinforcement contingent. He was last seen stumbling through the mud blindly, with a possible facial injury. A body identified as his was found in 1992, although that identification has been challenged. In 2015, the Commonwealth War Grave Commission confirmed that it had correctly identified the burial place of John Kipling; they record his date of death as 27 September 1915, and that he is buried at St Mary\\'s A.D.S. Cemetery, Haisnes.After his son\\'s death, in a poem entitled \"Epitaphs of the War,\" Kipling wrote, \"If any question why we died / Tell them, because our fathers lied.\" Critics have speculated that these words may express Kipling\\'s guilt over his role in arranging John\\'s commission. Professor Tracy Bilsing contends that the line refers to Kipling\\'s disgust that British leaders failed to learn the lessons of the Boer War, and were unprepared for the struggle with Germany in 1914, with the \"lie\" of the \"fathers\" being that the British Army was prepared for any war when it was not.John\\'s death has been linked to Kipling\\'s 1916 poem \"My Boy Jack,\"  notably in the play My Boy Jack and its subsequent television adaptation, along with the documentary Rudyard Kipling: A Remembrance Tale. However, the poem was originally published at the head of a story about the Battle of Jutland and appears to refer to a death at sea; the \"Jack\" referred to is probably a generic \"Jack Tar.\"  In the Kipling family, Jack was the name of the family dog, while John Kipling was always John, making the identification of the protagonist of \"My Boy Jack\" with John Kipling somewhat questionable. However, Kipling was indeed emotionally devastated by the death of his son. He is said to have assuaged his grief by reading the novels of Jane Austen aloud to his wife and daughter. During the war, he wrote a booklet The Fringes of the Fleet containing essays and poems on various nautical subjects of the war. Some of these were set to music by the English composer Edward Elgar.\\nKipling became friends with a French soldier named Maurice Hammoneau, whose life had been saved in the First World War when his copy of Kim, which he had in his left breast pocket, stopped a bullet. Hammoneau presented Kipling with the book, with bullet still embedded, and his Croix de Guerre as a token of gratitude. They continued to correspond, and when Hammoneau had a son, Kipling insisted on returning the book and medal.On 1 August 1918, a poem, \"The Old Volunteer,\"  appeared under his name in The Times. The next day, he wrote to the newspaper to disclaim authorship and a correction appeared. Although The Times employed a private detective to investigate, the detective appears to have suspected Kipling himself of being the author, and the identity of the hoaxer was never established.\\n\\n\\n== After the war (1918–1936) ==\\n\\nPartly in response to John\\'s death, Kipling joined Sir Fabian Ware\\'s Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission), the group responsible for the garden-like British war graves that can be found to this day dotted along the former Western Front and the other places in the world where British Empire troops lie buried. His main contributions to the project were his selection of the biblical phrase, \"Their Name Liveth For Evermore\" (Ecclesiasticus 44.14, KJV), found on the Stones of Remembrance in larger war cemeteries, and his suggestion of the phrase \"Known unto God\" for the gravestones of unidentified servicemen. He also chose the inscription \"The Glorious Dead\" on the Cenotaph, Whitehall, London. Additionally, he wrote a two-volume history of the Irish Guards, his son\\'s regiment, published in 1923 and seen as one of the finest examples of regimental history.Kipling\\'s short story \"The Gardener\" depicts visits to the war cemeteries, and the poem \"The King\\'s Pilgrimage\" (1922) a journey which King George V made, touring the cemeteries and memorials under construction by the Imperial War Graves Commission. With the increasing popularity of the automobile, Kipling became a motoring correspondent for the British press, writing enthusiastically of trips around England and abroad, though he was usually driven by a chauffeur.\\nAfter the war, Kipling was sceptical of the Fourteen Points and the League of Nations, but had hopes that the United States would abandon isolationism and the post-war world be dominated by an Anglo-French-American alliance. He hoped the United States would take on a League of Nations mandate for Armenia as the best way of preventing isolationism, and hoped that Theodore Roosevelt, whom Kipling admired, would again become president. Kipling was saddened by Roosevelt\\'s death in 1919, believing him to be the only American politician capable of keeping the United States in the \"game\" of world politics.Kipling was hostile towards communism, writing of the Bolshevik take-over in 1917 that one sixth of the world had \"passed bodily out of civilization.\" In a 1918 poem, Kipling wrote of Soviet Russia that everything good in Russia had been destroyed by the Bolsheviks – all that was left was \"the sound of weeping and the sight of burning fire, and the shadow of a people trampled into the mire.\" In 1920, Kipling co-founded the Liberty League with Haggard and Lord Sydenham. This short-lived enterprise focused on promoting classic liberal ideals as a response to the rising power of communist tendencies within Great Britain, or as Kipling put it, \"to combat the advance of Bolshevism.\" \\n\\nIn 1922, Kipling, having referred to the work of engineers in some of his poems, such as \"The Sons of Martha,\"  \"Sappers,\"  and \"McAndrew\\'s Hymn,\"  and in other writings, including short-story anthologies such as The Day\\'s Work, was asked by a University of Toronto civil engineering professor, Herbert E. T. Haultain, for assistance in developing a dignified obligation and ceremony for graduating engineering students. Kipling was enthusiastic in his response and shortly produced both, formally entitled \"The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer.\"  Today engineering graduates all across Canada are presented with an iron ring at a ceremony to remind them of their obligation to society. In 1922 Kipling became Lord Rector of St Andrews University in Scotland, a three-year position.\\nKipling, as a Francophile, argued strongly for an Anglo-French alliance to uphold the peace, calling Britain and France in 1920 the \"twin fortresses of European civilization.\"  Similarly, Kipling repeatedly warned against revising the Treaty of Versailles in Germany\\'s favour, which he predicted would lead to a new world war. An admirer of Raymond Poincaré, Kipling was one of few British intellectuals who supported the French Occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, at a time when the British government and most public opinion was against the French position. In contrast to the popular British view of Poincaré as a cruel bully intent on impoverishing Germany with unreasonable reparations, Kipling argued that he was rightfully trying to preserve France as a great power in the face of an unfavourable situation. Kipling argued that even before 1914, Germany\\'s larger economy and higher birth rate had made that country stronger than France; with much of France devastated by war and the French suffering heavy losses meant that its low birth rate would give it trouble, while Germany was mostly undamaged and still with a higher birth rate. So he reasoned that the future would bring German domination if Versailles were revised in Germany\\'s favour, and it was madness for Britain to press France to do so.\\n\\nIn 1924, Kipling was opposed to the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald as \"Bolshevism without bullets.\"  He believed that Labour was a communist front organisation, and \"excited orders and instructions from Moscow\" would expose Labour as such to the British people. Kipling\\'s views were on the right. Though he admired Benito Mussolini to some extent in the 1920s, he was against fascism, calling Oswald Mosley was \"a bounder and an arriviste.\"  By 1935, he was calling Mussolini a deranged and dangerous egomaniac and in 1933 wrote, \"The Hitlerites are out for blood.\" Despite his anti-communism, the first major translations of Kipling into Russian took place under Lenin\\'s rule in the early 1920s, and Kipling was popular with Russian readers in the interwar period. Many younger Russian poets and writers, such as Konstantin Simonov, were influenced by him. Kipling\\'s clarity of style, use of colloquial language and employment of rhythm and rhyme were seen as major innovations in poetry that appealed to many younger Russian poets.\\nThough it was obligatory for Soviet journals to begin translations of Kipling with an attack on him as a \"fascist\" and an \"imperialist,\"  such was Kipling\\'s popularity with Russian readers that his works were not banned in the Soviet Union until 1939, with the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The ban was lifted in 1941 after Operation Barbarossa, when Britain become a Soviet ally, but imposed for good with the Cold War in 1946.\\n\\nMany older editions of Rudyard Kipling\\'s books have a swastika printed on the cover, associated with a picture of an elephant carrying a lotus flower, reflecting the influence of Indian culture. Kipling\\'s use of the swastika was based on the Indian sun symbol conferring good luck and the Sanskrit word meaning \"fortunate\" or \"well-being.\"  He used the swastika symbol in both right and left-facing forms, and it was in general use by others at the time.In a note to Edward Bok after the death of Lockwood Kipling in 1911, Rudyard said: \"I am sending with this for your acceptance, as some little memory of my father to whom you were so kind, the original of one of the plaques that he used to make for me. I thought it being the Swastika would be appropriate for your Swastika. May it bring you even more good fortune.\" Once the Nazis came to power and usurped the swastika, Kipling ordered that it should no longer adorn his books. Less than a year before his death, Kipling gave a speech (titled \"An Undefended Island\") to the Royal Society of St George on 6 May 1935, warning of the danger which Nazi Germany posed to Britain.Kipling scripted the first Royal Christmas Message, delivered via the BBC\\'s Empire Service by George V in 1932. In 1934, he published a short story in The Strand Magazine, \"Proofs of Holy Writ,\"  postulating that William Shakespeare had helped to polish the prose of the King James Bible.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nKipling kept writing until the early 1930s, but at a slower pace and with less success than before. On the night of 12 January 1936 he suffered a haemorrhage in his small intestine. He underwent surgery, but died less than a week later on 18 January 1936, at the age of 70 of a perforated duodenal ulcer. His death had previously been incorrectly announced in a magazine, to which he wrote, \"I\\'ve just read that I am dead. Don\\'t forget to delete me from your list of subscribers.\"The pallbearers at the funeral included Kipling\\'s cousin, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, and the marble casket was covered by a Union Jack. Kipling was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in north-west London, and his ashes interred at Poets\\' Corner, part of the South Transept of Westminster Abbey, next to the graves of Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy. Kipling\\'s will was proven on 6 April, with his estate valued at £168,141 2s. 11d. (roughly equivalent to £11,508,703 in 2019).\\n\\n\\n=== Legacy ===\\nIn 2010, the International Astronomical Union approved that a crater on the planet Mercury should be named after Kipling – one of ten newly discovered impact craters observed by the MESSENGER spacecraft in 2008–2009. In 2012, an extinct species of crocodile, Goniopholis kiplingi, was named in his honour \"in recognition for his enthusiasm for natural sciences.\" More than 50 unpublished poems by Kipling, discovered by the American scholar Thomas Pinney, were released for the first time in March 2013.Kipling\\'s writing has strongly influenced that of others. His stories for adults remain in print and have garnered high praise from writers as different as Poul Anderson, Jorge Luis Borges, and Randall Jarrell, who wrote, \"After you have read Kipling\\'s fifty or seventy-five best stories you realize that few men have written this many stories of this much merit, and that very few have written more and better stories.\"His children\\'s stories remain popular and his Jungle Books made into several films. The first was made by producer Alexander Korda. Other films have been produced by The Walt Disney Company. A number of his poems were set to music by Percy Grainger. A series of short films based on some of his stories was broadcast by the BBC in 1964. Kipling\\'s work is still popular today.\\nThe poet T. S. Eliot edited A Choice of Kipling\\'s Verse (1941) with an introductory essay. Eliot was aware of the complaints that had been levelled against Kipling and he dismissed them one by one: that Kipling is \"a Tory\" using his verse to transmit right wing political views, or \"a journalist\" pandering to popular taste; while Eliot writes, \"I cannot find any justification for the charge that he held a doctrine of race superiority.\" Eliot finds instead,\\n\\nAn immense gift for using words, an amazing curiosity and power of observation with his mind and with all his senses, the mask of the entertainer, and beyond that a queer gift of second sight, of transmitting messages from elsewhere, a gift so disconcerting when we are made aware of it that thenceforth we are never sure when it is not present: all this makes Kipling a writer impossible wholly to understand and quite impossible to belittle.\\nOf Kipling\\'s verse, such as his Barrack-Room Ballads, Eliot writes \"of a number of poets who have written great poetry, only... a very few whom I should call great verse writers. And unless I am mistaken, Kipling\\'s position in this class is not only high, but unique.\"In response to Eliot, George Orwell wrote a long consideration of Kipling\\'s work for Horizon in 1942, noting that although as a \"jingo imperialist\" Kipling was \"morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting,\"  his work had many qualities which ensured that while \"every enlightened person has despised him... nine-tenths of those enlightened persons are forgotten and Kipling is in some sense still there.\":\\n\\nOne reason for Kipling\\'s power [was] his sense of responsibility, which made it possible for him to have a world-view, even though it happened to be a false one. Although he had no direct connexion with any political party, Kipling was a Conservative, a thing that does not exist nowadays. Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals, Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists. He identified himself with the ruling power and not with the opposition. In a gifted writer this seems to us strange and even disgusting, but it did have the advantage of giving Kipling a certain grip on reality. The ruling power is always faced with the question, \\'In such and such circumstances, what would you do?\\', whereas the opposition is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions. Where it is a permanent and pensioned opposition, as in England, the quality of its thought deteriorates accordingly. Moreover, anyone who starts out with a pessimistic, reactionary view of life tends to be justified by events, for Utopia never arrives and \\'the gods of the copybook headings\\', as Kipling himself put it, always return. Kipling sold out to the British governing class, not financially but emotionally. This warped his political judgement, for the British ruling class were not what he imagined, and it led him into abysses of folly and snobbery, but he gained a corresponding advantage from having at least tried to imagine what action and responsibility are like. It is a great thing in his favour that he is not witty, not \\'daring\\', has no wish to épater les bourgeois. He dealt largely in platitudes, and since we live in a world of platitudes, much of what he said sticks. Even his worst follies seem less shallow and less irritating than the \\'enlightened\\' utterances of the same period, such as Wilde\\'s epigrams or the collection of cracker-mottoes at the end of Man and Superman.\\nIn 1939, the poet W.H. Auden celebrated KIpling in a similarly left-handed way in his elegy for William Butler Yeats. Auden deleted this section from more recent editions of his poems.\\n\\nThe poet Alison Brackenbury writes, \"Kipling is poetry\\'s Dickens, an outsider and journalist with an unrivalled ear for sound and speech.\"The English folk singer Peter Bellamy was a lover of Kipling\\'s poetry, much of which he believed to have been influenced by English traditional folk forms. He recorded several albums of Kipling\\'s verse set to traditional airs, or to tunes of his own composition written in traditional style. However, in the case of the bawdy folk song, \"The Bastard King of England,\"  which is commonly credited to Kipling, it is believed that the song is actually misattributed.Kipling is often quoted in discussions of contemporary British political and social issues. In 1911, Kipling wrote the poem The Reeds of Runnymede that celebrated Magna Carta, and summoned up a vision of the \"stubborn Englishry\" determined to defend their rights. In 1996, the following verses of the poem were quoted by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warning against the encroachment of the European Union on national sovereignty:\\n\\nPolitical singer-songwriter Billy Bragg, who attempts to build a left-wing English nationalism in contrast with the more common right-wing English nationalism, has attempted to \\'reclaim\\' Kipling for an inclusive sense of Englishness. Kipling\\'s enduring relevance has been noted in the United States, as it has become involved in Afghanistan and other areas about which he wrote.\\n\\n\\n=== Links with camping and scouting ===\\nIn 1903, Kipling gave permission to Elizabeth Ford Holt to borrow themes from the Jungle Books to establish Camp Mowglis, a summer camp for boys on the shores of Newfound Lake in New Hampshire. Throughout their lives, Kipling and his wife Carrie maintained an active interest in Camp Mowglis, which still continues the traditions that Kipling inspired. Buildings at Mowglis have names such as Akela, Toomai, Baloo, and Panther. The campers are referred to as \"the Pack,\"  from the youngest \"Cubs\" to the oldest living in \"Den.\"Kipling\\'s links with the Scouting movements were also strong. Robert Baden-Powell, founder of Scouting, used many themes from Jungle Book stories and Kim in setting up his junior Wolf Cubs. These ties still exist, such as the popularity of \"Kim\\'s Game.\"  The movement is named after Mowgli\\'s adopted wolf family, and adult helpers of Wolf Cub Packs take names from The Jungle Book, especially the adult leader called Akela after the leader of the Seeonee wolf pack.\\n\\n\\n=== Kipling\\'s Burwash home ===\\n\\nAfter the death of Kipling\\'s wife in 1939, his house, Bateman\\'s in Burwash, East Sussex, where he had lived from 1902 until 1936, was bequeathed to the National Trust. It is now a public museum dedicated to the author. Elsie Bambridge, his only child who lived to maturity, died childless in 1976, and bequeathed her copyrights to the National Trust, which in turn donated them to the University of Sussex to ensure better public access.Novelist and poet Sir Kingsley Amis wrote a poem, \"Kipling at Bateman\\'s,\"  after visiting Burwash (where Amis\\'s father lived briefly in the 1960s) as part of a BBC television series on writers and their houses.In 2003, actor Ralph Fiennes read excerpts from Kipling\\'s works from the study in Bateman\\'s, including, The Jungle Book, Something of Myself, Kim, and The Just So Stories, and poems, including \"If ...\" and \"My Boy Jack,\"  for a CD published by the National Trust.\\n\\n\\n=== Reputation in India ===\\nIn modern-day India, whence he drew much of his material, Kipling\\'s reputation remains controversial, especially amongst modern nationalists and some post-colonial critics. Rudyard Kipling was a prominent supporter of Colonel Reginald Dyer, who was responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar (in the province of Punjab). Kipling called Dyer \"the man who saved India\" and initiated collections for the latter\\'s homecoming prize. However, Subhash Chopra writes in his book Kipling Sahib – the Raj Patriot that the benefit fund was started by The Morning Post newspaper, not by Kipling, and that Kipling made no contribution to the Dyer fund. While Kipling\\'s name was conspicuously absent from the list of donors as published in The Morning Post, he clearly admired Dyer.Other contemporary Indian intellectuals such as Ashis Nandy have taken a more nuanced view. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, often described Kipling\\'s novel Kim as one of his favourite books.G. V. Desani, an Indian writer of fiction, had a more negative opinion of Kipling. He alludes to Kipling in his novel, All About H. Hatterr:\\n\\nI happen to pick up R. Kipling\\'s autobiographical Kim.\\nTherein, this self-appointed whiteman\\'s burden-bearing sherpa feller\\'s stated how, in the Orient, blokes hit the road and think nothing of walking a thousand miles in search of something.\\nIndian writer Khushwant Singh wrote in 2001 that he considers Kipling\\'s \"If—\" \"the essence of the message of The Gita in English,\"  referring to the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Indian scripture.  Indian writer R. K. Narayan said, \"Kipling, the supposed expert writer on India, showed a better understanding of the mind of the animals in the jungle than of the men in an Indian home or the marketplace.\"  The Indian politician and writer Sashi Tharoor commented \"Kipling, that flatulent voice of Victorian imperialism, would wax eloquent on the noble duty to bring law to those without it\".In November 2007, it was announced that Kipling\\'s birth home in the campus of the J. J. School of Art in Mumbai would be turned into a museum celebrating the author and his works.\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\nKipling\\'s bibliography includes fiction (including novels and short stories), non-fiction, and poetry.

       "  'Full text': 'Adeline Virginia Woolf (; née Stephen; 25 January 1882 –  28 March 1941) was an English writer, considered one of the most important modernist 20th-century authors and also a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device.\\nWoolf was born into an affluent household in South Kensington, London, the seventh child in a blended family of eight. Her mother, Julia Prinsep Jackson, celebrated as a Pre-Raphaelite artist\\'s model, had three children from her first marriage, while Woolf\\'s father, Leslie Stephen, a notable man of letters, had one previous daughter. The Stephens produced another four children, including the modernist painter Vanessa Bell. While the boys in the family received college educations, the girls were home-schooled in English classics and Victorian literature. An important influence in Virginia Woolf\\'s early life was the summer home the family used in St Ives, Cornwall, where she first saw the Godrevy Lighthouse, which was to become central in her novel To the Lighthouse (1927).\\nWoolf\\'s childhood came to an abrupt end in 1895 with the death of her mother and her first mental breakdown, followed two years later by the death of her half-sister and a mother figure to her, Stella Duckworth. From 1897 to 1901, she attended the Ladies\\' Department of King\\'s College London, where she studied classics and history and came into contact with early reformers of women\\'s higher education and the women\\'s rights movement. Other important influences were her Cambridge-educated brothers and unfettered access to her father\\'s vast library.\\nEncouraged by her father, Woolf began writing professionally in 1900. Her father\\'s death in 1905 caused another mental breakdown for Woolf. Following his death, the Stephen family moved from Kensington to the more bohemian Bloomsbury, where they adopted a free-spirited lifestyle. It was in Bloomsbury where, in conjunction with the brothers\\' intellectual friends, they formed the artistic and literary Bloomsbury Group.\\nIn 1912, she married Leonard Woolf, and in 1917 the couple founded the Hogarth Press, which published much of her work. They rented a home in Sussex and moved there permanently in 1940. Throughout her life, Woolf was troubled by her mental illness. She was institutionalised several times and attempted suicide at least twice. Her illness may have been bipolar disorder, for which there was no effective intervention during her lifetime. In 1941, at age 59, Woolf died by putting rocks in her coat pockets and drowning herself in the River Ouse at Lewes.\\nDuring the interwar period, Woolf was an important part of London\\'s literary and artistic society. In 1915 she published her first novel, The Voyage Out, through her half-brother\\'s publishing house, Gerald Duckworth and Company. Her best-known works include the novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927) and Orlando (1928). She is also known for her essays, including A Room of One\\'s Own (1929), in which she wrote the much-quoted dictum, \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.\"\\nWoolf became one of the central subjects of the 1970s movement of feminist criticism and her works have since garnered much attention and widespread commentary for \"inspiring feminism.\" Her works have been translated into more than 50 languages. A large body of literature is dedicated to her life and work, and she has been the subject of plays, novels and films. Woolf is commemorated today by statues, societies dedicated to her work and a building at the University of London.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family of origin ===\\n\\nVirginia Woolf was born Adeline Virginia Stephen on 25 January 1882 at 22 Hyde Park Gate in South Kensington, London, to Julia (née Jackson) (1846–1895) and Leslie Stephen (1832–1904), writer, historian, essayist, biographer and mountaineer. Julia Jackson was born in 1846 in Calcutta, Bengal, British India, to John Jackson and Maria \"Mia\" Theodosia Pattle, from two Anglo-Indian families. John Jackson FRCS was the third son of George Jackson and Mary Howard of Bengal, a physician who spent 25 years with the Bengal Medical Service and East India Company and a professor at the fledgling Calcutta Medical College. While John Jackson was an almost invisible presence, the Pattle family (see Pattle family tree) were famous beauties, and moved in the upper circles of Bengali society. The seven Pattle sisters married into important families. Julia Margaret Cameron was a celebrated photographer, while Virginia married Earl Somers, and their daughter, Julia Jackson\\'s cousin, was Lady Henry Somerset, the temperance leader. Julia moved to England with her mother at the age of two and spent much of her early life with another of her mother\\'s sisters, Sarah Monckton Pattle. Sarah and her husband Henry Thoby Prinsep, conducted an artistic and literary salon at Little Holland House where she came into contact with a number of Pre-Raphaelite painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, for whom she modelled.Julia was the youngest of three sisters and Adeline Virginia Stephen was named after her mother\\'s eldest sister Adeline Maria Jackson (1837–1881) and her mother\\'s aunt Virginia Pattle (see Pattle family tree and Table of ancestors). Because of the tragedy of her aunt Adeline\\'s death the previous year, the family never used Virginia\\'s first name. The Jacksons were a well educated, literary and artistic proconsular middle-class family. In 1867, Julia Jackson married Herbert Duckworth, a barrister, but within three years was left a widow with three infant children. She was devastated and entered a prolonged period of mourning, abandoning her faith and turning to nursing and philanthropy.\\nJulia and Herbert Duckworth had three children;\\nGeorge (5 March 1868 – 1934), a senior civil servant, married Lady Margaret Herbert 1904\\nStella (30 May 1869 – 19 July 1897), died aged 28\\nGerald (29 October 1870 – 1937), founder of Duckworth Publishing, married Cecil Alice Scott-Chad 1921Leslie Stephen was born in 1832 in South Kensington to Sir James and Lady Jane Catherine Stephen (née Venn), daughter of John Venn, rector of Clapham. The Venns were the centre of the evangelical Clapham sect. Sir James Stephen was the under secretary at the Colonial Office, and with another Clapham member, William Wilberforce, was responsible for the passage of the Slavery Abolition Bill in 1833. In 1849 he was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University. As a family of educators, lawyers and writers the Stephens represented the elite intellectual aristocracy. While his family were distinguished and intellectual, they were less colourful and aristocratic than Julia Jackson\\'s. A graduate and fellow of Cambridge University he renounced his faith and position to move to London where he became a notable man of letters. In addition he was a rambler and mountaineer, described as a \"gaunt figure with the ragged red brown beard...a formidable man, with an immensely high forehead, steely-blue eyes, and a long pointed nose\". In the same year as Julia Jackson\\'s marriage, he wed Harriet Marian (Minny) Thackeray (1840–1875), youngest daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray, who bore him a daughter, Laura (1870–1945), but died in childbirth in 1875. Laura turned out to be developmentally disabled and was eventually institutionalised.The widowed Julia Duckworth knew Leslie Stephen through her friendship with Minny\\'s elder sister Anne (Anny) Isabella Ritchie and had developed an interest in his agnostic writings. She was present the night Minny died and later, tended to Leslie Stephen and helped him move next door to her on Hyde Park Gate so Laura could have some companionship with her own children. Both were preoccupied with mourning and although they developed a close friendship and intense correspondence, agreed it would go no further. Leslie Stephen proposed to her in 1877, an offer she declined, but when Anny married later that year she accepted him and they were married on 26 March 1878. He and Laura then moved next door into Julia\\'s house, where they lived till his death in 1904. Julia was 32 and Leslie was 46.Their first child, Vanessa, was born on 30 May 1879. Julia, having presented her husband with a child, and now having five children to care for, had decided to limit her family to this. However, despite the fact that the couple took \"precautions\", \"contraception was a very imperfect art in the nineteenth century\" resulting in the birth of three more children over the next four years.\\n\\n\\n=== 22 Hyde Park Gate (1882–1904) ===\\n\\n\\n==== 1882–1895 ====\\n\\nVirginia Woolf provides insight into her early life in her autobiographical essays, including Reminiscences (1908), 22 Hyde Park Gate (1921) and A Sketch of the Past (1940). Other essays that provide insight into this period include Leslie Stephen (1932). She also alludes to her childhood in her fictional writing. In To the Lighthouse (1927), her depiction of the life of the Ramsays in the Hebrides is an only thinly disguised account of the Stephens in Cornwall and the Godrevy Lighthouse they would visit there. However, Woolf\\'s understanding of her mother and family evolved considerably between 1907 and 1940, in which the somewhat distant, yet revered figure of her mother becomes more nuanced and filled in.In February 1891, with her sister Vanessa, Woolf began the Hyde Park Gate News, chronicling life and events within the Stephen family, and modelled on the popular magazine Tit-Bits. Initially this was mainly Vanessa\\'s and Thoby\\'s articles, but very soon Virginia became the main contributor, with Vanessa as editor. Their mother\\'s response when it first appeared was \"Rather clever I think\". The following year the Stephen sisters also used photography to supplement their insights, as did Stella Duckworth. Vanessa Bell\\'s 1892 portrait of her sister and parents in the Library at Talland House (see image) was one of the family\\'s favourites, and was written about lovingly in Leslie Stephen\\'s memoir. In 1897 (\"the first really lived year of my life)\" Virginia began her first diary, which she kept for the next twelve years, and a notebook in 1909.Virginia was, as she describes it, \"born into a large connection, born not of rich parents, but of well-to-do parents, born into a very communicative, literate, letter writing, visiting, articulate, late nineteenth century world\". It was a well-connected family consisting of six children, with two half brothers and a half sister (the Duckworths, from her mother\\'s first marriage), another half sister, Laura (from her father\\'s first marriage), and an older sister, Vanessa and brother Thoby. The following year, another brother Adrian followed. The disabled Laura Stephen lived with the family until she was institutionalised in 1891. Julia and Leslie had four children together:\\nVanessa \"Nessa\" (30 May 1879 – 1961), married Clive Bell 1907\\nThoby (9 September 1880 – 1906), founded Bloomsbury Group\\nVirginia \"Jinny\"/\"Ginia\" (25 January 1882 – 1941), married Leonard Woolf 1912\\nAdrian (27 October 1883 – 1948), married Karin Costelloe 1914Virginia was born at 22 Hyde Park Gate and lived there till her father\\'s death in 1904. Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington, lay at the south-east end of Hyde Park Gate, a narrow cul-de-sac running south from Kensington Road, just west of the Royal Albert Hall, and opposite Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, where the family regularly took their walks (see Map; Street plan). Built in 1846 by Henry Payne of Hammersmith as one of a row of single family townhouses for the upper middle class, it soon became too small for their expanding family. At the time of their marriage, it consisted of a basement, two stories and an attic. In July 1886 Leslie Stephen obtained the services of J. W. Penfold, architect, to add additional living space above and behind the existing structure. The substantial renovations added a new top floor (see image of red brick extension), with three bedrooms and a study for himself, converted the original attic into rooms, and added the first bathroom. It was a tall but narrow townhouse, that at that time had no running water. Virginia would later describe it as \"a very tall house on the left hand side near the bottom which begins by being stucco and ends by being red brick; which is so high and yet—as I can say now that we have sold it—so rickety that it seems as if a very high wind would topple it over\".The servants worked \"downstairs\" in the basement. The ground floor had a drawing room, separated by a curtain from the servant\\'s pantry and a library. Above this on the first floor were Julia and Leslie\\'s bedrooms. On the next floor were the Duckworth children\\'s rooms, and above them the day and night nurseries of the Stephen children occupied two further floors. Finally in the attic, under the eaves, were the servant\\'s bedrooms, accessed by a back staircase. Life at 22 Hyde Park Gate was also divided symbolically, as Virginia put it \"The division in our lives was curious. Downstairs there was pure convention: upstairs pure intellect. But there was no connection between them\", the worlds typified by George Duckworth and Leslie Stephen. Their mother, it seems, was the only one who could span this divide. The house was described as dimly lit and crowded with furniture and paintings. Within it the younger Stephens formed a close-knit group. Life in London differed sharply from their summers in Cornwall, their outdoor activities consisting mainly of walks in nearby Kensington Gardens, where they would play hide-and-seek, and sail their boats on the Round Pond, while indoors, it revolved around their lessons.Leslie Stephen\\'s eminence as an editor, critic, and biographer, and his connection to William Thackeray, meant that his children were raised in an environment filled with the influences of Victorian literary society. Henry James, George Henry Lewes, Alfred Tennyson, Thomas Hardy, Edward Burne-Jones and Virginia\\'s honorary godfather, James Russell Lowell, were among the visitors to the house. Julia Stephen was equally well connected. Her aunt was a pioneering early photographer, Julia Margaret Cameron, who was also a visitor to the Stephen household. The two Stephen sisters, Vanessa and Virginia, were almost three years apart in age, and exhibited some sibling rivalry. Virginia christened her older sister \"the saint\" and was far more inclined to exhibit her cleverness than her more reserved sister. Virginia resented the domesticity Victorian tradition forced on them, far more than her sister. They also competed for Thoby\\'s affections. Virginia would later confess her ambivalence over this rivalry to Duncan Grant in 1917. \"indeed one of the concealed worms of my life has been a sister\\'s jealousy – of a sister I mean; and to feed this I have invented such a myth about her that I scarce know one from t\\'other\".Virginia showed an early affinity for writing. Although both parents disapproved of formal education for females, writing was considered a respectable profession for women, and her father encouraged her in this respect. Later, she would describe this as \"ever since I was a little creature, scribbling a story in the manner of Hawthorne on the green plush sofa in the drawing room at St. Ives while the grown-ups dined\". By the age of five she was writing letters and could tell her father a story every night. Later, she, Vanessa and Adrian would develop the tradition of inventing a serial about their next-door neighbours, every night in the nursery, or in the case of St. Ives, of spirits that resided in the garden. It was her fascination with books that formed the strongest bond between her and her father. For her tenth birthday, she received an ink-stand, a blotter, drawing book and a box of writing implements.\\n\\n\\n==== Talland House (1882–1894) ====\\n\\nLeslie Stephen was in the habit of hiking in Cornwall, and in the spring of 1881 he came across a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall, and took out a lease on it that September. Although it had limited amenities, its main attraction was the view overlooking Porthminster Bay towards the Godrevy Lighthouse, which the young Virginia could see from the upper windows and was to be the central figure in her To the Lighthouse (1927). It was a large square house, with a terraced garden, divided by hedges, sloping down towards the sea. Each year between 1882 and 1894 from mid-July to mid-September the Stephen family leased Talland House as a summer residence. Leslie Stephen, who referred to it thus: \"a pocket-paradise\", described it as \"The pleasantest of my memories... refer to our summers, all of which were passed in Cornwall, especially to the thirteen summers (1882–1894) at St Ives. There we bought the lease of Talland House: a small but roomy house, with a garden of an acre or two all up and down hill, with quaint little terraces divided by hedges of escallonia, a grape-house and kitchen-garden and a so-called \\'orchard\\' beyond\". It was in Leslie\\'s words, a place of \"intense domestic happiness\". Virginia herself described the house in great detail: \\n\\nIn both London and Cornwall, Julia was perpetually entertaining, and was notorious for her manipulation of her guests\\' lives, constantly matchmaking in the belief everyone should be married, the domestic equivalence of her philanthropy. As her husband observed, \"My Julia was of course, though with all due reserve, a bit of a matchmaker\". Amongst their guests in 1893 were the Brookes, whose children, including Rupert Brooke, played with the Stephen children. Rupert and his group of Cambridge Neo-pagans would come to play an important role in their lives in the years prior to the First World War. While Cornwall was supposed to be a summer respite, Julia Stephen soon immersed herself in the work of caring for the sick and poor there, as well as in London. Both at Hyde Park Gate and Talland House, the family mingled with much of the country\\'s literary and artistic circles. Frequent guests included literary figures such as Henry James and George Meredith, as well as James Russell Lowell, and the children were exposed to much more intellectual conversations than at their mother\\'s Little Holland House. The family did not return, following Julia Stephen\\'s death in May 1895.For the children, it was the highlight of the year, and Virginia\\'s most vivid childhood memories were not of London but of Cornwall. In a diary entry of 22 March 1921, she described why she felt so connected to Talland House, looking back to a summer day in August 1890. \"Why am I so incredibly and incurably romantic about Cornwall? One\\'s past, I suppose; I see children running in the garden … The sound of the sea at night … almost forty years of life, all built on that, permeated by that: so much I could never explain\". Cornwall inspired aspects of her work, in particular the \"St Ives Trilogy\" of Jacob\\'s Room (1922), To the Lighthouse (1927), and The Waves (1931).\\n\\n\\n==== 1895–1904 ====\\n\\nJulia Stephen fell ill with influenza in February 1895, and never properly recovered, dying on 5 May, when Virginia was only 13. This was a pivotal moment in her life and the beginning of her struggles with mental illness. Essentially, her life had fallen apart. The Duckworths were travelling abroad at the time of their mother\\'s death, and Stella returned immediately to take charge and assume her role. That summer, rather than return to the memories of St Ives, the Stephens went to Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where a number of their mother\\'s family lived. It was there that Virginia had the first of her many nervous breakdowns, and Vanessa was forced to assume some of her mother\\'s role in caring for Virginia\\'s mental state. Stella became engaged to Jack Hills the following year and they were married on 10 April 1897, making Virginia even more dependent on her older sister.\\nGeorge Duckworth also assumed some of their mother\\'s role, taking upon himself the task of bringing them out into society. First Vanessa, then Virginia, in both cases an equal disaster, for it was not a rite of passage which resonated with either girl and attracted a scathing critique by Virginia regarding the conventional expectations of young upper-class women: \"Society in those days was a perfectly competent, perfectly complacent, ruthless machine. A girl had no chance against its fangs. No other desires – say to paint, or to write – could be taken seriously\". Rather her priorities were to escape from the Victorian conventionality of the downstairs drawing room to a \"room of one\\'s own\" to pursue her writing aspirations. She would revisit this criticism in her depiction of Mrs Ramsay stating the duties of a Victorian mother in To the Lighthouse \"an unmarried woman has missed the best of life\".The death of Stella Duckworth on 19 July 1897, after a long illness, was a further blow to Virginia\\'s sense of self, and the family dynamics. Woolf described the period following the death of both her mother and Stella as \"1897–1904 – the seven unhappy years\", referring to \"the lash of a random unheeding flail that pointlessly and brutally killed the two people who should, normally and naturally, have made those years, not perhaps happy but normal and natural\". In April 1902, their father became ill, and although he underwent surgery later that year he never fully recovered, dying on 22 February 1904. Virginia\\'s father\\'s death precipitated a further breakdown. Later, Virginia would describe this time as one in which she was dealt successive blows as a \"broken chrysalis\" with wings still creased. Chrysalis occurs many times in Woolf\\'s writing but the \"broken chrysalis\" was an image that became a metaphor for those exploring the relationship between Woolf and grief. At his death, Leslie Stephen\\'s net worth was £15,715 6s. 6d. (probate 23 March 1904)\\n\\n\\n==== Education ====\\nIn the late nineteenth century, education was sharply divided along gender lines, a tradition that Virginia would note and condemn in her writing. Boys were sent to school, and in upper-middle-class families such as the Stephens, this involved private boys schools, often boarding schools, and university. Girls, if they were afforded the luxury of education, received it from their parents, governesses and tutors. Virginia was educated by her parents who shared the duty. There was a small classroom off the back of the drawing room, with its many windows, which they found perfect for quiet writing and painting. Julia taught the children Latin, French and History, while Leslie taught them mathematics. They also received piano lessons. Supplementing their lessons was the children\\'s unrestricted access to Leslie Stephen\\'s vast library, exposing them to much of the literary canon, resulting in a greater depth of reading than any of their Cambridge contemporaries, Virginia\\'s reading being described as \"greedy\". Later, she would recall Even today there may be parents who would doubt the wisdom of allowing a girl of fifteen the free run of a large and quite unexpurgated library. But my father allowed it. There were certain facts – very briefly, very shyly he referred to them. Yet \"Read what you like\", he said, and all his books . . . were to be had without asking. After public school, the boys in the family all attended Cambridge University. The girls derived some indirect benefit from this, as the boys introduced them to their friends. Another source was the conversation of their father\\'s friends, to whom they were exposed. Leslie Stephen described his circle as \"most of the literary people of mark ... clever young writers and barristers, chiefly of the radical persuasion ... we used to meet on Wednesday and Sunday evenings, to smoke and drink and discuss the universe and the reform movement\".\\nLater, between the ages of 15 and 19, Virginia was able to pursue higher education. She took courses of study, some at degree level, in beginning and advanced Ancient Greek, intermediate Latin and German, together with continental and English history at the Ladies\\' Department of King\\'s College London at nearby 13 Kensington Square between 1897 and 1901. She studied Greek under the eminent scholar George Charles Winter Warr, professor of Classical Literature at King\\'s. In addition she had private tutoring in German, Greek and Latin. One of her Greek tutors was Clara Pater (1899–1900), who taught at King\\'s. Another was Janet Case, who involved her in the women\\'s rights movement, and whose obituary Virginia would later write in 1937. Her experiences there led to her 1925 essay \"On Not Knowing Greek\". Her time at King\\'s also brought her into contact with some of the early reformers of women\\'s higher education such as the principal of the Ladies\\' Department, Lilian Faithfull (one of the so-called steamboat ladies), in addition to Pater. Her sister Vanessa also enrolled at the Ladies\\' Department (1899–1901). Although the Stephen girls could not attend Cambridge, they were to be profoundly influenced by their brothers\\' experiences there. When Thoby went up to Trinity in 1899, he befriended a circle of young men, including Clive Bell, Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf (whom Virginia would later marry) and Saxon Sydney-Turner, that he would soon introduce to his sisters at the Trinity May Ball in 1900. These men formed a reading group they named the Midnight Society.\\n\\n\\n==== Relationships with family ====\\nAlthough Virginia expressed the opinion that her father was her favourite parent, and although she had only just turned thirteen when her mother died, she was profoundly influenced by her mother throughout her life. It was Virginia who famously stated that \"for we think back through our mothers if we are women\", and invoked the image of her mother repeatedly throughout her life in her diaries, her letters and a number of her autobiographical essays, including Reminiscences (1908), 22 Hyde Park Gate (1921) and A Sketch of the Past (1940), frequently evoking her memories with the words \"I see her ...\". She also alludes to her childhood in her fictional writing. In To the Lighthouse (1927), the artist, Lily Briscoe, attempts to paint Mrs Ramsay, a complex character based on Julia Stephen, and repeatedly comments on the fact that she was \"astonishingly beautiful\". Her depiction of the life of the Ramsays in the Hebrides is an only thinly disguised account of the Stephens in Cornwall and the Godrevy Lighthouse they would visit there. However, Woolf\\'s understanding of her mother and family evolved considerably between 1907 and 1940, in which the somewhat distant, yet revered figure becomes more nuanced and filled in.While her father painted Julia Stephen\\'s work in terms of reverence, Woolf drew a sharp distinction between her mother\\'s work and \"the mischievous philanthropy which other women practise so complacently and often with such disastrous results\". She describes her degree of sympathy, engagement, judgement and decisiveness, and her sense of both irony and the absurd. She recalls trying to recapture \"the clear round voice, or the sight of the beautiful figure, so upright and distinct, in its long shabby cloak, with the head held at a certain angle, so that the eye looked straight out at you\". Julia Stephen dealt with her husband\\'s depressions and his need for attention, which created resentment in her children, boosted his self-confidence, nursed her parents in their final illness, and had many commitments outside the home that would eventually wear her down. Her frequent absences and the demands of her husband instilled a sense of insecurity in her children that had a lasting effect on her daughters. In considering the demands on her mother, Woolf described her father as \"fifteen years her elder, difficult, exacting, dependent on her\" and reflected that this was at the expense of the amount of attention she could spare her young children, \"a general presence rather than a particular person to a child\", reflecting that she rarely ever spent a moment alone with her mother, \"someone was always interrupting\". Woolf was ambivalent about all this, yet eager to separate herself from this model of utter selflessness. In To the Lighthouse, she describes it as \"boasting of her capacity to surround and protect, there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by; all was so lavished and spent\". At the same time, she admired the strengths of her mother\\'s womanly ideals. Given Julia\\'s frequent absences and commitments, the young Stephen children became increasingly dependent on Stella Duckworth, who emulated her mother\\'s selflessness, as Woolf wrote \"Stella was always the beautiful attendant handmaid ... making it the central duty of her life\".Julia Stephen greatly admired her husband\\'s intellect. As Woolf observed \"she never belittled her own works, thinking them, if properly discharged, of equal, though other, importance with her husband\\'s\". She believed with certainty in her role as the centre of her activities, and the person who held everything together, with a firm sense of what was important and valuing devotion. Of the two parents, Julia\\'s \"nervous energy dominated the family\". While Virginia identified most closely with her father, Vanessa stated her mother was her favourite parent. Angelica Garnett recalls how Virginia asked Vanessa which parent she preferred, although Vanessa considered it a question that \"one ought not to ask\", she was unequivocal in answering \"Mother\" yet the centrality of her mother to Virginia\\'s world is expressed in this description of her \"Certainly there she was, in the very centre of that great Cathedral space which was childhood; there she was from the very first\". Virginia observed that her half-sister, Stella, the oldest daughter, led a life of total subservience to her mother, incorporating her ideals of love and service. Virginia quickly learned, that like her father, being ill was the only reliable way of gaining the attention of her mother, who prided herself on her sickroom nursing.Another issue the children had to deal with was Leslie Stephen\\'s temper, Woolf describing him as \"the tyrant father\". Eventually, she became deeply ambivalent about her father. He had given her his ring on her eighteenth birthday and she had a deep emotional attachment as his literary heir, writing about her \"great devotion for him\". Yet, like Vanessa, she also saw him as victimiser and tyrant. She had a lasting ambivalence towards him through her life, albeit one that evolved. Her adolescent image was of an \"Eminent Victorian\" and tyrant but as she grew older she began to realise how much of him was in her \"I have been dipping into old letters and father\\'s memoirs....so candid and reasonable and transparent—and had such a fastidious delicate mind, educated, and transparent\", she wrote (22 December 1940). She was in turn both fascinated and condemnatory of Leslie Stephen \" She [her mother] has haunted me: but then, so did that old wretch my father. . . . I was more like him than her, I think; and therefore more critical: but he was an adorable man, and somehow, tremendous\".\\n\\n\\n==== Sexual abuse ====\\nMuch has been made of Virginia\\'s statements that she was continually sexually abused during the whole time that she lived at 22 Hyde Park Gate, as a possible cause of her mental health issues, although there are likely to be a number of contributing factors. She states that she first remembers being molested by Gerald Duckworth when she was six years old. It has been suggested that this led to a lifetime of sexual fear and resistance to\\nmasculine authority. Against a background of over-committed and distant parents, suggestions that this was a dysfunctional family must be evaluated. These include evidence of sexual abuse of the Stephen girls by their older Duckworth stepbrothers, and by their cousin, James Kenneth Stephen (1859–1892), at least of Stella Duckworth. Laura is also thought to have been abused. The most graphic account is by Louise DeSalvo, but other authors and reviewers have been more cautious. Lee states that, \"The evidence is strong enough, and yet ambiguous enough, to open the way for conflicting psychobiographical interpretations that draw quite different shapes of Virginia Woolf\\'s interior life\".\\n\\n\\n=== Bloomsbury (1904–1940) ===\\n\\n\\n==== Gordon Square (1904–1907) ====\\n\\nOn their father\\'s death, the Stephens\\' first instinct was to escape from the dark house of yet more mourning, and this they did immediately, accompanied by George, travelling to Manorbier, on the coast of Pembrokeshire on 27 February. There, they spent a month, and it was there that Virginia first came to realise her destiny was as a writer, as she recalls in her diary of 3 September 1922. They then further pursued their new found freedom by spending April in Italy and France, where they met up with Clive Bell again. Virginia then suffered her second nervous breakdown, and first suicidal attempt on 10 May, and convalesced over the next three months.Before their father died, the Stephens had discussed the need to leave South Kensington in the West End, with its tragic memories and their parents\\' relations. George Duckworth was 35, his brother Gerald 33. The Stephen children were now between 24 and 20. Virginia was 22. Vanessa and Adrian decided to sell 22 Hyde Park Gate in respectable South Kensington and move to Bloomsbury. Bohemian Bloomsbury, with its characteristic leafy squares seemed sufficiently far away, geographically and socially, and was a much cheaper neighbourhood to rent in. They had not inherited much and they were unsure about their finances. Also, Bloomsbury was close to the Slade School which Vanessa was then attending. While Gerald was quite happy to move on and find himself a bachelor establishment, George who had always assumed the role of quasi-parent decided to accompany them, much to their dismay. It was then that Lady Margaret Herbert appeared on the scene, George proposed, was accepted and married in September, leaving the Stephens to their own devices.Vanessa found a house at 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury, and they moved in November, to be joined by Virginia now sufficiently recovered. It was at Gordon Square that the Stephens began to regularly entertain Thoby\\'s intellectual friends in March 1905. The circle, which largely came from the Cambridge Apostles, included writers (Saxon Sydney-Turner, Lytton Strachey) and critics (Clive Bell, Desmond MacCarthy) with Thursday evening \"At Homes\" that became known as the Thursday Club, a vision of recreating Trinity College (\"Cambridge in London\"). This circle formed the nucleus of the intellectual circle of writers and artists known as the Bloomsbury Group. Later, it would include John Maynard Keynes (1907), Duncan Grant (1908), E. M. Forster (1910), Roger Fry (1910), Leonard Woolf (1911) and David Garnett (1914).\\n\\nIn 1905, Virginia and Adrian visited Portugal and Spain. Clive Bell proposed to Vanessa, but was declined, while Virginia began teaching evening classes at Morley College and Vanessa added another event to their calendar with the Friday Club, dedicated to the discussion of and later exhibition of the fine arts. This introduced some new people into their circle, including Vanessa\\'s friends from the Royal Academy and Slade, such as Henry Lamb and Gwen Darwin (who became secretary), but also the eighteen-year-old Katherine Laird (\"Ka\") Cox (1887–1938), who was about to go up to Newnham. Although Virginia did not actually meet Ka until much later, Ka would come to play an important part in her life. Ka and others brought the Bloomsbury Group into contact with another, slightly younger, group of Cambridge intellectuals to whom the Stephen sisters gave the name \"Neo-pagans\". The Friday Club continued until 1913.The following year, 1906, Virginia suffered two further losses. Her cherished brother Thoby, who was only 26, died of typhoid, following a trip they had all taken to Greece, and immediately after Vanessa accepted Clive\\'s third proposal. Vanessa and Clive were married in February 1907 and as a couple, their interest in avant-garde art would have an important influence on Woolf\\'s further development as an author. With Vanessa\\'s marriage, Virginia and Adrian needed to find a new home.\\n\\n\\n==== Fitzroy Square (1907–1911) ====\\n\\nVirginia moved into 29 Fitzroy Square in April 1907, a house on the west side of the street, formerly occupied by George Bernard Shaw. It was in Fitzrovia, immediately to the west of Bloomsbury but still relatively close to her sister at Gordon Square. The two sisters continued to travel together, visiting Paris in March. Adrian was now to play a much larger part in Virginia\\'s life, and they resumed the Thursday Club in October at their new home, while Gordon Square became the venue for the Play Reading Society in December. During this period, the group began to increasingly explore progressive ideas, first in speech, and then in conduct, Vanessa proclaiming in 1910 a libertarian society with sexual freedom for all.Meanwhile, Virginia began work on her first novel, Melymbrosia that eventually became The Voyage Out (1915). Vanessa\\'s first child, Julian was born in February 1908, and in September Virginia accompanied the Bells to Italy and France. It was during this time that Virginia\\'s rivalry with her sister resurfaced, flirting with Clive, which he reciprocated, and which lasted on and off from 1908 to 1914, by which time her sister\\'s marriage was breaking down. On 17 February 1909, Lytton Strachey proposed to Virginia and she accepted, but he then withdrew the offer.It was while she was at Fitzroy Square that the question arose of Virginia needing a quiet country retreat, and she required a six-week rest cure and sought the countryside away from London as much as possible. In December, she and Adrian stayed at Lewes and started exploring the area of Sussex around the town. She started to want a place of her own, like St Ives, but closer to London. She soon found a property in nearby Firle (see below), maintaining a relationship with that area for the rest of her life.\\n\\n\\n===== Dreadnought hoax 1910 =====\\n\\nSeveral members of the group attained notoriety in 1910 with the Dreadnought hoax, which Virginia participated in disguised as a male Abyssinian royal. Her complete 1940 talk on the hoax was discovered and is published in the memoirs collected in the expanded edition of The Platform of Time (2008).\\n\\n\\n==== Brunswick Square (1911–1912) ====\\nIn October 1911, the lease on Fitzroy Square was running out and Virginia and Adrian decided to give up their home on Fitzroy Square in favour of a different living arrangement, moving to a four-storied house at 38 Brunswick Square in Bloomsbury proper in November. Virginia saw it as a new opportunity; \"We are going to try all kinds of experiments,\" she told Ottoline Morrell. Adrian occupied the second floor, with Maynard Keynes and Duncan Grant sharing the ground floor. This arrangement for a single woman was considered scandalous, and George Duckworth was horrified. The house was adjacent to the Foundling Hospital, much to Virginia\\'s amusement as an unchaperoned single woman. Originally, Ka Cox was supposed to share in the arrangements, but opposition came from Rupert Brooke, who was involved with her and pressured her to abandon the idea. At the house, Duncan Grant decorated Adrian Stephen\\'s rooms (see image).\\n\\n\\n=== Marriage (1912–1941) ===\\n\\nLeonard Woolf was one of Thoby Stephen\\'s friends at Trinity College, Cambridge, and noticed the Stephen sisters in Thoby\\'s rooms there on their visits to the May Ball in 1900 and 1901. He recalls them in \"white dresses and large hats, with parasols in their hands, their beauty literally took one\\'s breath away\". To him, they were silent, \"formidable and alarming\".Woolf did not meet Virginia formally till 17 November 1904 when he dined with the Stephens at Gordon Square, to say goodbye before leaving to take up a position with the civil service in Ceylon, although she was aware of him through Thoby\\'s stories. At that visit he noted that she was perfectly silent throughout the meal, and looked ill. In 1909, Lytton Strachey suggested to Woolf he should make her an offer of marriage. He did so, but received no answer. In June 1911, he returned to London on a one-year leave, but did not go back to Ceylon. In England again, Leonard renewed his contacts with family and friends. Three weeks after arriving he dined with Vanessa and Clive Bell at Gordon Square on 3 July, where they were later joined by Virginia and other members of what would later be called \"Bloomsbury\", and Leonard dates the group\\'s formation to that night. In September, Virginia asked Leonard to join her at Little Talland House at Firle in Sussex for a long weekend. After that weekend they began seeing each other more frequently.On 4 December 1911, Leonard moved into the ménage on Brunswick Square, occupying a bedroom and sitting room on the fourth floor, and started to see Virginia constantly and by the end of the month had decided he was in love with her. On 11 January 1912, he proposed to her; she asked for time to consider, so he asked for an extension of his leave and, on being refused, offered his resignation on 25 April, effective 20 May. He continued to pursue Virginia, and in a letter of 1 May 1912 (which see) she explained why she did not favour a marriage. However, on 29 May, Virginia told Leonard that she wished to marry him, and they were married on 10 August at the St Pancras Register Office. It was during this time that Leonard first became aware of Virginia\\'s precarious mental state. The Woolfs continued to live at Brunswick Square until October 1912, when they moved to a small flat at 13 Clifford\\'s Inn, further to the east (subsequently demolished). Despite his low material status (Woolf referring to Leonard during their engagement as a \"penniless Jew\"), the couple shared a close bond. Indeed, in 1937, Woolf wrote in her diary: \"Love-making—after 25 years can\\'t bear to be separate ... you see it is enormous pleasure being wanted: a wife. And our marriage so complete.\" However, Virginia made a suicide attempt in 1913.In October 1914, Leonard and Virginia Woolf moved away from Bloomsbury and central London to Richmond, living at 17 The Green, a home discussed by Leonard in his autobiography Beginning Again (1964). In early March 1915, the couple moved again, to nearby Hogarth House, Paradise Road, after which they named their publishing house. Virginia\\'s first novel, The Voyage Out was published in 1915, followed by another suicide attempt. Despite the introduction of conscription in 1916, Leonard was exempted on medical grounds.Between 1924 and 1940, the Woolfs returned to Bloomsbury, taking out a ten-year lease at 52 Tavistock Square, from where they ran the Hogarth Press from the basement, where Virginia also had her writing room, and is commemorated with a bust of her in the square (see illustration). 1925 saw the publication of Mrs Dalloway in May followed by her collapse while at Charleston in August. In 1927, her next novel, To the Lighthouse, was published, and the following year she lectured on Women & Fiction at Cambridge University and published Orlando in October. Her two Cambridge lectures then became the basis for her major essay A Room of One\\'s Own in 1929. Virginia wrote only one drama, Freshwater, based on her great-aunt Julia Margaret Cameron, and produced at her sister\\'s studio on Fitzroy Street in 1935. 1936 saw another collapse of her health following the completion of The Years.The Woolf\\'s final residence in London was at 37 Mecklenburgh Square (1939–1940), destroyed during the Blitz in September 1940, a month later their previous home on Tavistock Square was also destroyed. After that, they made Sussex their permanent home. For descriptions and illustrations of all Virginia Woolf\\'s London homes, see Jean Moorcroft Wilson\\'s book Virginia Woolf Life and London. A Biography of Place (pub. Cecil Woolf, 1987).\\n\\n\\n==== Hogarth Press (1917–1938) ====\\n\\nVirginia had taken up book-binding as a pastime in October 1901, at the age of 19, and the Woolfs had been discussing setting up a publishing house for some time, and at the end of 1916 started making plans. Having discovered that they were not eligible to enroll in the St Bride School of Printing, they started purchasing supplies after seeking advice from the Excelsior Printing Supply Company on Farringdon Road in March 1917, and soon they had a printing press set up on their dining room table at Hogarth House, and the Hogarth Press was born.Their first publication was Two Stories in July 1917, inscribed Publication No. 1, and consisted of two short stories, \"The Mark on the Wall\" by Virginia Woolf and Three Jews by Leonard Woolf. The work consisted of 32 pages, hand bound and sewn, and illustrated by woodcuts designed by Dora Carrington. The illustrations were a success, leading Virginia to remark that the press was \"specially good at printing pictures, and we see that we must make a practice of always having pictures\" (13 July 1917). The process took two and a half months with a production run of 150 copies. Other short short stories followed, including Kew Gardens (1919) with a woodblock by Vanessa Bell as frontispiece. Subsequently, Bell added further illustrations, adorning each page of the text.The press subsequently published Virginia\\'s novels along with works by T. S. Eliot, Laurens van der Post, and others. The Press also commissioned works by contemporary artists, including Dora Carrington and Vanessa Bell. Woolf believed that to break free of a patriarchal society women writers needed a \"room of their own\" to develop and often fantasised about an \"Outsider\\'s Society\" where women writers would create a virtual private space for themselves via their writings to develop a feminist critique of society. Though Woolf never created the \"Outsider\\'s society\", the Hogarth Press was the closest approximation as the Woolfs chose to publish books by writers that took unconventional points of view to form a reading community. Initially the press concentrated on small experimental publications, of little interest to large commercial publishers. Until 1930, Woolf often helped her husband print the Hogarth books as the money for employees was not there. Virginia relinquished her interest in 1938, following a third attempted suicide. After it was bombed in September 1940, the press was moved to Letchworth for the remainder of the war. Both the Woolfs were internationalists and pacifists who believed that promoting understanding between peoples was the best way to avoid another world war and chose quite consciously to publish works by foreign authors of whom the British reading public were unaware. The first non-British author to be published was the Soviet writer Maxim Gorky, the book Reminiscences of Leo Nikolaiovich Tolstoy in 1920, dealing with his friendship with Count Leo Tolstoy.\\n\\n\\n==== Memoir Club (1920–1941) ====\\n\\n1920 saw a postwar reconstitution of the Bloomsbury Group, under the title of the Memoir Club, which as the name suggests focussed on self-writing, in the manner of Proust\\'s A La Recherche, and inspired some of the most influential books of the twentieth century. The Group, which had been scattered by the war, was reconvened by Mary (\\'Molly\\') MacCarthy who called them \"Bloomsberries\", and operated under rules derived from the Cambridge Apostles, an elite university debating society that a number of them had been members of. These rules emphasised candour and openness. Among the 125 memoirs presented, Virginia contributed three that were published posthumously in 1976, in the autobiographical anthology Moments of Being. These were 22 Hyde Park Gate (1921), Old Bloomsbury (1922) and Am I a Snob? (1936).\\n\\n\\n==== Vita Sackville-West (1922–1941) ====\\n\\nThe ethos of the Bloomsbury group encouraged a liberal approach to sexuality, and on 14 December 1922 Woolf met the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, while dining with Clive Bell. Writing in her diary the next day, she referred to meeting \"the lovely gifted aristocratic Sackville West\". At the time, Sackville-West was the more successful writer as both poet and novelist, commercially and critically, and it was not until after Woolf\\'s death that she became considered the better writer. After a tentative start, they began a sexual relationship, which, according to Sackville-West in a letter to her husband on 17 August 1926, was only twice consummated. The relationship reached its peak between 1925 and 1928, evolving into more of a friendship through the 1930s, though Woolf was also inclined to brag of her affairs with other women within her intimate circle, such as Sibyl Colefax and Comtesse de Polignac. This period of intimacy was to prove fruitful for both authors, Woolf producing three novels, To the Lighthouse (1927), Orlando (1928) and The Waves (1931) as well as a number of essays, including \"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown\" (1924) and \"A Letter to a Young Poet\" (1932).Sackville-West worked tirelessly to lift up Woolf\\'s self-esteem, encouraging her not to view herself as a quasi-reclusive inclined to sickness who should hide herself away from the world, but rather offered praise for her liveliness and wit, her health, her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to reappraise herself, developing a more positive self-image, and the feeling that her writings were the products of her strengths rather than her weakness. Starting at the age of 15, Woolf had believed the diagnosis by her father and his doctor that reading and writing were deleterious to her nervous condition, requiring a regime of physical labour such as gardening to prevent a total nervous collapse. This led Woolf to spend much time obsessively engaging in such physical labour.Sackville-West was the first to argue to Woolf she had been misdiagnosed, and that it was far better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves—advice that was taken. Under the influence of Sackville-West, Woolf learned to deal with her nervous ailments by switching between various forms of intellectual activities such as reading, writing and book reviews, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength and worsened her nerves. Sackville-West chose the financially struggling Hogarth Press as her publisher to assist the Woolfs financially. Seducers in Ecuador, the first of the novels by Sackville-West published by Hogarth, was not a success, selling only 1500 copies in its first year, but the next Sackville-West novel they published, The Edwardians, was a best-seller that sold 30,000 copies in its first six months. Sackville-West\\'s novels, though not typical of the Hogarth Press, saved Hogarth, taking them from the red into the black. However, Woolf was not always appreciative of the fact that it was Sackville-West\\'s books that kept the Hogarth Press profitable, writing dismissively in 1933 of her \"servant girl\" novels. The financial security allowed by the good sales of Sackville-West\\'s novels in turn allowed Woolf to engage in more experimental work, such as The Waves, as Woolf had to be cautious when she depended upon Hogarth entirely for her income.In 1928, Woolf presented Sackville-West with Orlando, a fantastical biography in which the eponymous hero\\'s life spans three centuries and both sexes. It was published in October, shortly after the two women spent a week travelling together in France, that September. Nigel Nicolson, Vita Sackville-West\\'s son, wrote, \"The effect of Vita on Virginia is all contained in Orlando, the longest and most charming love letter in literature, in which she explores Vita, weaves her in and out of the centuries, tosses her from one sex to the other, plays with her, dresses her in furs, lace and emeralds, teases her, flirts with her, drops a veil of mist around her.\" After their affair ended, the two women remained friends until Woolf\\'s death in 1941. Virginia Woolf also remained close to her surviving siblings, Adrian and Vanessa; Thoby had died of typhoid fever at the age of 26.\\n\\n\\n=== Sussex (1911–1941) ===\\n\\nVirginia was needing a country retreat to escape to, and on 24 December 1910 Virginia found a house for rent in Firle, Sussex, near Lewes (see Map). She obtained a lease and took possession of the house the following month, and named it \\n\\'Little Talland House\", after their childhood home in Cornwall, although it was actually a new red gabled villa on the main street opposite the village hall. The lease was a short one and in October she and Leonard Woolf found Asham House at Asheham a few miles to the west, while walking along the Ouse from Firle. The house, at the end of a tree-lined road was a strange beautiful Regency-Gothic house in a lonely location. She described it as \"flat, pale, serene, yellow-washed\", without electricity or water and allegedly haunted. She took out a five-year lease jointly with Vanessa in the New Year, and they moved into it in February 1912, holding a house warming party on the 9th.It was at Asham that the Woolfs spent their wedding night later that year. At Asham, she recorded the events of the weekends and holidays they spent there in her Asham Diary, part of which was later published as A Writer\\'s Diary in 1953. In terms of creative writing, The Voyage Out was completed there, and much of Night and Day. Asham provided Woolf with well needed relief from the pace of London life and was where she found a happiness that she expressed in her diary of 5 May 1919 \"Oh, but how happy we\\'ve been at Asheham! It was a most melodious time. Everything went so freely; – but I can\\'t analyse all the sources of my joy\". Asham was also the inspiration for A Haunted House (1921–1944), and was painted by members of the Bloomsbury Group, including Vanessa Bell and Roger Fry. It was during these times at Asham that Ka Cox (seen here) started to devote herself to Virginia and become very useful.\\n\\nWhile at Asham Leonard and Virginia found a farmhouse in 1916, that was to let, about four miles away, which they thought would be ideal for her sister. Eventually, Vanessa came down to inspect it, and moved in in October of that year, taking it as a summer home for her family. The Charleston Farmhouse was to become the summer gathering place for the literary and artistic circle of the Bloomsbury Group.After the end of the war, in 1918, the Woolfs were given a year\\'s notice by the landlord, who needed the house. In mid-1919, \"in despair\", they purchased \"a very strange little house\" for £300, the Round House in Pipe Passage, Lewes, a converted windmill. No sooner had they bought the Round House, than Monk\\'s House in nearby Rodmell, came up for auction, a weatherboarded house with oak beamed rooms, said to be 15th or 16th century. The Leonards favoured the latter because of its orchard and garden, and sold the Round House, to purchase Monk\\'s House for £700. Monk\\'s House also lacked water and electricity, but came with an acre of garden, and had a view across the Ouse towards the hills of the South Downs. Leonard Woolf describes this view (and the amenities) as being unchanged since the days of Chaucer. From 1940 it became their permanent home after their London home was bombed, and Virginia continued to live there until her death. Meanwhile, Vanessa had also made Charleston her permanent home in 1936. It was at Monk\\'s House that Virginia completed Between the Acts in early 1941, followed by a further breakdown directly resulting in her suicide on 28 March 1941, the novel being published posthumously later that year.\\n\\n\\n=== The Neo-pagans (1911–1912) ===\\n\\nDuring her time in Firle, Virginia became better acquainted with Rupert Brooke and his group of Neo-Pagans, pursuing socialism, vegetarianism, exercising outdoors and alternative life styles, including social nudity. They were influenced by the ethos of Bedales, Fabianism and Shelley. The women wore sandals, socks, open neck shirts and head-scarves, as Virginia does here. Although she had some reservations, Woolf was involved with their activities for a while, fascinated by their bucolic innocence in contrast to the sceptical intellectualism of Bloomsbury, which earned her the nickname \"The Goat\" from her brother Adrian. While Woolf liked to make much of a weekend she spent with Brooke at the vicarage in Grantchester, including swimming in the pool there, it appears to have been principally a literary assignation. They also shared a psychiatrist in the name of Maurice Craig. Through the Neo-Pagans, she finally met Ka Cox on a weekend in Oxford in January 1911, who had been part of the Friday Club circle and now became her friend and played an important part in dealing with her illnesses. Virginia nicknamed her \"Bruin\". At the same time, she found herself dragged into a triangular relationship involving Ka, Jacques Raverat and Gwen Darwin. She became resentful of the other couple, Jacques and Gwen, who married later in 1911, not the outcome Virginia had predicted or desired. They would later be referred to in both To the Lighthouse and The Years. The exclusion she felt evoked memories of both Stella Duckworth\\'s marriage and her triangular involvement with Vanessa and Clive.The two groups eventually fell out. Brooke pressured Ka into withdrawing from joining Virginia\\'s ménage on Brunswick Square in late 1911, calling it a \"bawdy-house\" and by the end of 1912 he had vehemently turned against Bloomsbury. Later, she would write sardonically about Brooke, whose premature death resulted in his idealisation, and express regret about \"the Neo-Paganism at that stage of my life\". Virginia was deeply disappointed when Ka married William Edward Arnold-Forster in 1918, and became increasingly critical of her.\\n\\n\\n=== Mental health ===\\nMuch examination has been made of Woolf\\'s mental health (e.g. see Mental health bibliography). From the age of 13, following the death of her mother, Woolf suffered periodic mood swings from severe depression to manic excitement, including psychotic episodes, which the family referred to as her \"madness\". But as Hermione Lee points out, she was not \"mad\", she was merely a woman who suffered from and struggled with illness for much of her relatively short life, a woman of \"exceptional courage, intelligence and stoicism\", a woman who made the best use, and achieved the best understanding, she could of that illness. Psychiatrists today consider that her illness constitutes bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness). Her mother\\'s death in 1895, \"the greatest disaster that could happen\", precipitated a crisis of alternating excitability and depression accompanied by irrational fears, for which their family doctor, Dr Seton prescribed rest, stopping lessons and regular walks supervised by Stella, and she stopped writing. Yet, just two years later, Stella too was dead, bringing on her next crisis in 1897, and her first expressed wish for death at the age of fifteen, writing in her diary that October that \"death would be shorter & less painful\". She then stopped keeping a diary for some time. This was a scenario she would later recreate in \"Time Passes\" (To the Lighthouse, 1927).The death of her father in 1904 provoked her most alarming collapse, on 10 May, when she threw herself out of a window and she was briefly institutionalised under the care of her father\\'s friend, the eminent psychiatrist George Savage. Savage blamed her education, frowned on by many at the time as unsuitable for women, for her illness. She spent time recovering at the house of Stella\\'s friend Violet Dickinson, and at her aunt Caroline\\'s house in Cambridge, and by January 1905, Dr Savage considered her \"cured\". Violet, seventeen years older than Virginia, became one of her closest friends and one of her most effective nurses. She characterised this as a \"romantic friendship\" (Letter to Violet 4 May 1903). Her brother Thoby\\'s death in 1906, marked a \"decade of deaths\", that ended her childhood and adolescence. From then on her life was punctuated by urgent voices from the grave that at times seemed more real than her visual reality.On Dr Savage\\'s recommendation Virginia spent three short periods in 1910, 1912 and 1913 at Burley House at 15 Cambridge Park, Twickenham (see image), described as \"a private nursing home for women with nervous disorder\" run by Miss Jean Thomas. By the end of February 1910, she was becoming increasingly restless, and Dr Savage suggested being away from London. Vanessa rented Moat House outside Canterbury in June but there was no improvement, so Dr Savage sent her to Burley for a \"rest cure\". This involved partial isolation, deprivation of literature and force-feeding, and after six weeks she was able to convalesce in Cornwall and Dorset during the autumn. She loathed the experience, writing to her sister on 28 July she described how she found the phony religious atmosphere stifling, the institution ugly and informed Vanessa that to escape \"I shall soon have to jump out of a window\". The threat of being sent back would later lead to her contemplating suicide. Despite her protests, Savage would refer her back in 1912 for insomnia and in 1913 for depression. On emerging from Burley House in September 1913, she sought further opinions from two other physicians on the 13th, Maurice Wright, and Henry Head, who had been Henry James\\' physician. Both recommended she return to Burley House. Distraught, she returned home and attempted suicide by taking an overdose of 100 grains of veronal (a barbiturate), nearly dying, had she not been found by Ka Cox who summoned help. On recovery, she went to Dalingridge Hall, George Duckworth\\'s home in East Grinstead, Sussex, to convalesce on 30 September, accompanied by Ka Cox and a nurse, returning to Asham on 18 November with Janet Case and Ka Cox. She remained unstable over the next two years, with another incident involving veronal that she claimed was an \"accident\" and consulted another psychiatrist in April 1914, Maurice Craig, who explained that she was not sufficiently psychotic to be certified or committed to an institution. The rest of the summer of 1914 went better for her and they moved to Richmond, but in February 1915, just as The Voyage Out was due to be published, she relapsed once more and remained in poor health for most of that year, then despite Miss Thomas\\'s gloomy prognosis, she began to recover following 20 years of ill health. Nevertheless, there was a feeling among those around her that she was now permanently changed, and not for the better.Over the rest of her life she suffered recurrent bouts of depression. In 1940 a number of factors appeared to overwhelm her. Her biography of Roger Fry had been published in July and she had been disappointed in its reception. The horrors of war depressed her and their London homes had been destroyed in the Blitz in September and October. She had completed Between the Acts (1941 posthumously) in November, and completing a novel was frequently accompanied by exhaustion. Her health became increasingly a matter of concern, culminating in her decision to end her life on 28 March 1941.Though this instability would frequently affect her social life, she was able to continue her literary productivity with few interruptions throughout her life. Woolf herself provides not only a vivid picture of her symptoms in her diaries and letters, but also her response to the demons that haunted her and at times made her long for death \"But it is always a question whether I wish to avoid these glooms....These 9 weeks give one a plunge into deep waters....One goes down into the well & nothing protects one from the assault of truth\". Psychiatry had little to offer her in her lifetime, but she recognised that writing was one of the behaviours that enabled her to cope with her illness,  \"The only way I keep afloat...is by working....Directly I stop working I feel that I am sinking down, down. And as usual, I feel that if I sink further I shall reach the truth\". Sinking under water was Woolf\\'s metaphor for both the effects of depression and psychosis— but also finding truth, and ultimately was her choice of death. Throughout her life Woolf struggled, without success, to find meaning in her illness, on the one hand an impediment, on the other something she visualised as an essential part of who she was, and a necessary condition of her art. When she was able to control her illness, it informed her work, such as the character of Septimus Warren Smith in Mrs Dalloway (1925), who like Woolf was haunted by the dead, and ultimately takes his own life rather than be admitted to a sanitorium.Leonard Woolf relates how during the 30 years they were married they consulted many doctors in the Harley Street area, and although they were given a diagnosis of neurasthenia, he felt they had little understanding of the causes or nature. The solution was simple, as long as she lived a quiet life without any physical or mental exertion, she was well. On the other hand, any mental, emotional or physical strain resulted in a reappearance of her symptoms. These began with a headache, followed by insomnia and thoughts that started to race. Her remedy was simple, to retire to bed in a darkened room, eat, and drink plenty of milk, following which the symptoms slowly subsided.Modern scholars, including her nephew and biographer, Quentin Bell, have suggested her breakdowns and subsequent recurring depressive periods were also influenced by the sexual abuse to which she and her sister Vanessa were subjected by their half-brothers George and Gerald Duckworth (which Woolf recalls in her autobiographical essays A Sketch of the Past and 22 Hyde Park Gate) (see Sexual abuse). Biographers point out that when Stella died in 1897, there was no counterbalance to control George\\'s predation, and his night time prowling. Virginia describes him as her first lover, \"The old ladies of Kensington and Belgravia never knew that George Duckworth was not only father and mother, brother and sister to those poor Stephen girls; he was their lover also\".It is likely that other factors also played a part. It has been suggested that these include genetic predisposition, for both trauma and family history have been implicated in bipolar disorder. Virginia\\'s father, Leslie Stephen suffered from depression and her half-sister, Laura was institutionalised. Many of Virginia\\'s symptoms, including persistent headache, insomnia, irritability, and anxiety resemble those of her father. Another factor is the pressure she placed upon herself in her work, for instance, her breakdown of 1913 was at least partly triggered by the need to finish The Voyage Out. Virginia, herself, hinted that her illness was related to how she saw the repressed position of women in society, when she wrote in A Room of One\\'s Own that had Shakespeare had a sister of equal genius, \"she would certainly have gone crazed, shot herself, or ended her days in some lonely cottage outside the village, half witch, half wizard, feared and mocked at\". These inspirations emerged from what Woolf referred to as her lava of madness, describing her time at Burley in a 1930 letter to Ethel Smythe:\\n\\nAs an experience, madness is terrific I can assure you, and not to be sniffed at; and in its lava I still find most of the things I write about. It shoots out of one everything shaped, final, not in mere driblets, as sanity does. And the six months—not three—that I lay in bed taught me a good deal about what is called oneself. \\nThomas Caramagno and others, in discussing her illness, warn against the \"neurotic-genius\" way of looking at mental illness, which rationalises the theory that creativity is somehow born of mental illness. Stephen Trombley describes Woolf as having a confrontational relationship with her doctors, and possibly being a woman who is a \"victim of male medicine\", referring to the contemporary relative lack of understanding about mental illness.\\n\\n\\n=== Death ===\\n\\nAfter completing the manuscript of her last novel (posthumously published), Between the Acts (1941), Woolf fell into a depression similar to that which she had earlier experienced. The onset of World War II, the destruction of her London home during the Blitz, and the cool reception given to her biography of her late friend Roger Fry all worsened her condition until she was unable to work. When Leonard enlisted in the Home Guard, Virginia disapproved. She held fast to her pacifism and criticised her husband for wearing what she considered to be the silly uniform of the Home Guard.After World War II began, Woolf\\'s diary indicates that she was obsessed with death, which figured more and more as her mood darkened. On 28 March 1941, Woolf drowned herself by filling her overcoat pockets with stones and walking into the River Ouse near her home. Her body was not found until 18 April. Her husband buried her cremated remains beneath an elm tree in the garden of Monk\\'s House, their home in Rodmell, Sussex.In her suicide note, addressed to her husband, she wrote:\\n\\nDearest,\\nI feel certain that I am going mad again. I feel we can\\'t go through another of those terrible times. And I shan\\'t recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can\\'t concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don\\'t think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. I can\\'t fight it any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can\\'t even write this properly. I can\\'t read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that—everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can\\'t go on spoiling your life any longer. I don\\'t think two people could have been happier than we have been. V. \\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nWoolf is considered to be one of the most important twentieth century novelists. A modernist, she was one of the pioneers of using stream of consciousness as a narrative device, alongside contemporaries such as Marcel Proust, Dorothy Richardson and James Joyce. Woolf\\'s reputation was at its greatest during the 1930s, but declined considerably following World War II. The growth of feminist criticism in the 1970s helped re-establish her reputation.Virginia submitted her first article in 1890, to a competition in Tit-Bits. Although it was rejected, this shipboard romance by the 8-year-old would presage her first novel 25 years later, as would contributions to the Hyde Park News, such as the model letter \"to show young people the right way to express what is in their hearts\", a subtle commentary on her mother\\'s legendary matchmaking. She transitioned from juvenilia to professional journalism in 1904 at the age of 22. Violet Dickinson introduced her to Mrs Lyttelton, the editor of the Women\\'s Supplement of The Guardian, a Church of England newspaper. Invited to submit a 1,500-word article, Virginia sent Lyttelton a review of W. D. Howells\\' The Son of Royal Langbirth and an essay about her visit to Haworth that year, Haworth, November 1904. The review was published anonymously on 4 December, and the essay on the 21st. In 1905, Woolf began writing for The Times Literary Supplement.Woolf would go on to publish novels and essays as a public intellectual to both critical and popular acclaim. Much of her work was self-published through the Hogarth Press. \"Virginia Woolf\\'s peculiarities as a fiction writer have tended to obscure her central strength: she is arguably the major lyrical novelist in the English language. Her novels are highly experimental: a narrative, frequently uneventful and commonplace, is refracted—and sometimes almost dissolved—in the characters\\' receptive consciousness. Intense lyricism and stylistic virtuosity fuse to create a world overabundant with auditory and visual impressions\". \"The intensity of Virginia Woolf\\'s poetic vision elevates the ordinary, sometimes banal settings\"—often wartime environments—\"of most of her novels\".\\n\\n\\n=== Fiction and drama ===\\n\\n\\n==== Novels ====\\n\\nHer first novel, The Voyage Out, was published in 1915 at the age of 33, by her half-brother\\'s imprint, Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd. This novel was originally titled Melymbrosia, but Woolf repeatedly changed the draft. An earlier version of The Voyage Out has been reconstructed by Woolf scholar Louise DeSalvo and is now available to the public under the intended title. DeSalvo argues that many of the changes Woolf made in the text were in response to changes in her own life. The novel is set on a ship bound for South America, and a group of young Edwardians onboard and their various mismatched yearnings and misunderstandings. In the novel are hints of themes that would emerge in later work, including the gap between preceding thought and the spoken word that follows, and the lack of concordance between expression and underlying intention, together with how these reveal to us aspects of the nature of love.\\n\\n\"Mrs Dalloway (1925) centres on the efforts of Clarissa Dalloway, a middle-aged society woman, to organise a party, even as her life is paralleled with that of Septimus Warren Smith, a working-class veteran who has returned from the First World War bearing deep psychological scars\",\\n\\n\"To the Lighthouse (1927) is set on two days ten years apart. The plot centres on the Ramsay family\\'s anticipation of and reflection upon a visit to a lighthouse and the connected familial tensions. One of the primary themes of the novel is the struggle in the creative process that beset painter Lily Briscoe while she struggles to paint in the midst of the family drama. The novel is also a meditation upon the lives of a nation\\'s inhabitants in the midst of war, and of the people left behind.\" It also explores the passage of time, and how women are forced by society to allow men to take emotional strength from them.\\n\\nOrlando: A Biography (1928) is one of Virginia Woolf\\'s lightest novels. A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty (but who does abruptly turn into a woman), the book is in part a portrait of Woolf\\'s lover Vita Sackville-West. It was meant to console Vita for the loss of her ancestral home, Knole House, though it is also a satirical treatment of Vita and her work. In Orlando, the techniques of historical biographers are being ridiculed; the character of a pompous biographer is being assumed for it to be mocked.\\n\\n\"The Waves (1931) presents a group of six friends whose reflections, which are closer to recitatives than to interior monologues proper, create a wave-like atmosphere that is more akin to a prose poem than to a plot-centred novel\".\\n\\nFlush: A Biography (1933) is a part-fiction, part-biography of the cocker spaniel owned by Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The book is written from the dog\\'s point of view. Woolf was inspired to write this book from the success of the Rudolf Besier play The Barretts of Wimpole Street. In the play, Flush is on stage for much of the action. The play was produced for the first time in 1932 by the actress Katharine Cornell.\\n\\n\"Her last work, Between the Acts (1941), sums up and magnifies Woolf\\'s chief preoccupations: the transformation of life through art, sexual ambivalence, and meditation on the themes of flux of time and life, presented simultaneously as corrosion and rejuvenation—all set in a highly imaginative and symbolic narrative encompassing almost all of English history.\" This book is the most lyrical of all her works, not only in feeling but in style, being chiefly written in verse. While Woolf\\'s work can be understood as consistently in dialogue with the Bloomsbury Group, particularly its tendency (informed by G. E. Moore, among others) towards doctrinaire rationalism, it is not a simple recapitulation of the coterie\\'s ideals.\\n\\n\\n==== Themes ====\\nWoolf\\'s fiction has been studied for its insight into many themes including war, shell shock, witchcraft, and the role of social class in contemporary modern British society. In the postwar Mrs. Dalloway (1925), Woolf addresses the moral dilemma of war and its effects and provides an authentic voice for soldiers returning from World War I, suffering from shell shock, in the person of Septimus Smith. In A Room of One\\'s Own (1929) Woolf equates historical accusations of witchcraft with creativity and genius among women \"When, however, one reads of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, ...then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen\". Throughout her work Woolf tried to evaluate the degree to which her privileged background framed the lens through which she viewed class. She both examined her own position as someone who would be considered an elitist snob, but attacked the class structure of Britain as she found it. In her 1936 essay Am I a Snob?, she examined her values and those of the privileged circle she existed in. She concluded she was, and subsequent critics and supporters have tried to deal with the dilemma of being both elite and a social critic.Despite the considerable conceptual difficulties, given Woolf\\'s idiosyncratic use of language, her works have been translated into over 50 languages. Some writers, such as the Belgian Marguerite Yourcenar having had rather tense encounters with her, while others such as the Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges produced versions that were highly controversial.\\n\\n\\n==== Drama ====\\n\\nVirginia Woolf researched the life of her great-aunt, the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, publishing her findings in an essay titled Pattledom (1925), and later in her introduction to her 1926 edition of Cameron\\'s photographs. She had begun work on a play based on an episode in Cameron\\'s life in 1923, but abandoned it. Finally it was performed on 18 January 1935 at the studio of her sister, Vanessa Bell on Fitzroy Street in 1935. Woolf directed it herself, and the cast were mainly members of the Bloomsbury Group, including herself. Freshwater is a short three act comedy satirising the Victorian era, that was only performed once in Woolf\\'s lifetime. Beneath the comedic elements, there is an exploration of both generational change and artistic freedom. Both Cameron and Woolf fought against the class and gender dynamics of Victorianism and the play shows links to both To the Lighthouse and A Room of One\\'s Own that would follow.\\n\\n\\n=== Non-fiction ===\\nOver her relatively short life, Virginia Woolf wrote a body of autobiographical work and more than five hundred essays and reviews, some of which, like A Room of One\\'s Own (1929) were of book length. Not all were published in her lifetime. Shortly after her death, Leonard Woolf produced an edited edition of unpublished essays titled The Moment and other Essays, published by the Hogarth Press in 1947. Many of these were originally lectures that she gave, and several more volumes of essays followed, such as The Captain\\'s death bed: and other essays (1950).\\n\\n\\n==== A Room of One\\'s Own ====\\n\\nAmongst Woolf\\'s non-fiction works, one of the best known is A Room of One\\'s Own (1929), a book-length essay. Considered a key work of feminist literary criticism, it was written following two lectures she delivered on \"Women and Fiction\" at Cambridge University the previous year. In it, she examines the historical disempowerment women have faced in many spheres, including social, educational and financial. One of her most famous dicta is contained within the book \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\". Much of her argument (\"to show you how I arrived at this opinion about the room and the money\") is developed through the \"unsolved problems\" of women and fiction writing to arrive at her conclusion, although she claimed that was only \"an opinion upon one minor point\". In doing so, she states a good deal about the nature of women and fiction, employing a quasi-fictional style as she examines where women writers failed because of lack of resources and opportunities, examining along the way the experiences of the Brontës, George Eliot and George Sand, as well as the fictional character of Shakespeare\\'s sister, equipped with the same genius but not position. She contrasted these women who accepted a deferential status, to Jane Austen who wrote entirely as a woman.\\n\\n\\n=== Influences ===\\nA major influence on Woolf from 1912 onward was Russian literature as Woolf adopted many of its aesthetic conventions. The style of Fyodor Dostoyevsky with his depiction of a fluid mind in operation helped to influence Woolf\\'s writings about a \"discontinuous writing process\", though Woolf objected to Dostoyevsky\\'s obsession with \"psychological extremity\" and the \"tumultuous flux of emotions\" in his characters together with his right-wing, monarchist politics as Dostoyevsky was an ardent supporter of the autocracy of the Russian Empire. In contrast to her objections to Dostoyevsky\\'s \"exaggerated emotional pitch\", Woolf found much to admire in the work of Anton Chekhov and Leo Tolstoy. Woolf admired Chekhov for his stories of ordinary people living their lives, doing banal things and plots that had no neat endings. From Tolstoy, Woolf drew lessons about how a novelist should depict a character\\'s psychological state and the interior tension within. From Ivan Turgenev, Woolf drew the lessons that there are multiple \"I\\'s\" when writing a novel, and the novelist needed to balance those multiple versions of him- or herself to balance the \"mundane facts\" of a story vs. the writer\\'s overreaching vision, which required a \"total passion\" for art.Another influence on Woolf was the American writer Henry David Thoreau, with Woolf writing in a 1917 essay that her aim as a writer was to follow Thoreau by capturing \"the moment, to burn always with this hard, gem-like flame\" while praising Thoreau for his statement \"The millions are awake enough for physical labor, but only one in hundreds of millions is awake enough to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive\". Woolf praised Thoreau for his \"simplicity\" in finding \"a way for settling free the delicate and complicated machinery of the soul\". Like Thoreau, Woolf believed that it was silence that set the mind free to really contemplate and understand the world. Both authors believed in a certain transcendental, mystical approach to life and writing, where even banal things could be capable of generating deep emotions if one had enough silence and the presence of mind to appreciate them. Woolf and Thoreau were both concerned with the difficulty of human relationships in the modern age. Other notable influences include William Shakespeare, George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, Marcel Proust, Anton Chekhov, Emily Brontë, Daniel Defoe, James Joyce, and E. M. Forster.\\n\\n\\n=== List of selected publications ===\\n\\n\\n== Views ==\\nIn her lifetime, Woolf was outspoken on many topics that were considered controversial, some of which are now considered progressive, others regressive. She was an ardent feminist at a time when women\\'s rights were barely recognised, and anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist and a pacifist when chauvinism was popular. On the other hand, she has been criticised for views on class and race in her private writings and published works. Like many of her contemporaries, some of her writing is now considered offensive. As a result, she is considered polarising, a revolutionary feminist and socialist hero or a purveyor of hate speech.Works such as A Room of One\\'s Own (1929) and Three Guineas (1938) are frequently taught as icons of feminist literature in courses that would be very critical of some of her views expressed elsewhere. She has also been the recipient of considerable homophobic and misogynist criticism.\\n\\n\\n=== Humanist views ===\\nVirginia Woolf was born into a non-religious family and is regarded, along with her fellow Bloomsberries E. M. Forster and G. E. Moore, as a humanist. Both her parents were prominent agnostic atheists. Her father, Leslie Stephen, had become famous in polite society for his writings which expressed and publicised reasons to doubt the veracity of religion. Woolf\\'s mother, Julia Stephen, wrote the book Agnostic Women (1880), which argued that agnosticism (defined here as something more like atheism) could be a highly moral approach to life.\\nWoolf was a critic of Christianity. In a letter to Ethel Smyth, she gave a scathing denunciation of the religion, seeing it as self-righteous \"egotism\" and stating \"my Jew [Leonard] has more religion in one toenail—more human love, in one hair.\" Woolf stated in her private letters that she thought of herself as an atheist.\\nShe thought there were no Gods; no one was to blame; and so she evolved this atheist\\'s religion of doing good for the sake of goodness.\\n\\n\\n=== Controversies ===\\nHermione Lee cites a number of extracts from Woolf\\'s writings that many, including Lee, would consider offensive, and these criticisms can be traced back as far as those of Wyndham Lewis and Q. D. Leavis in the 1920s and 1930s. Other authors provide more nuanced contextual interpretations, and stress the complexity of her character and the apparent inherent contradictions in analysing her apparent flaws. She could certainly be off-hand, rude and even cruel in her dealings with other authors, translators and biographers, such as her treatment of Ruth Gruber. Some authors, particularly postcolonial feminists dismiss her (and modernist authors in general) as privileged, elitist, classist, racist, and antisemitic.\\nWoolf\\'s tendentious expressions, including prejudicial feelings against disabled people, have often been the topic of academic criticism:\\n The first quotation is from a diary entry of September 1920 and runs \"[t]he fact is the lower classes are detestable.\" The remainder follow the first in reproducing stereotypes standard to upper-class and upper-middle class life in the early twentieth century: \"imbeciles should certainly be killed\"; \"Jews\" are greasy; a \"crowd\" is both an ontological \"mass\" and is, again, \"detestable\"; \"Germans\" are akin to vermin; some \"baboon faced intellectuals\" mix with \"sad green dressed negroes and negresses, looking like chimpanzees\" at a peace conference; Kensington High St. revolts one\\'s stomach with its innumerable \"women of incredible mediocrity, drab as dishwater\".\\n\\n\\n=== Anti-semitism ===\\nThough accused of anti-semitism, the treatment of Judaism and Jews by Woolf is complex and far from straightforward. She was happily married to a Jewish man but often wrote about Jewish characters using stereotypical archetypes and generalisations. For instance, she described some of the Jewish characters in her work in terms that suggested they were physically repulsive or dirty. On the other hand, she could criticise her own views: \"How I hated marrying a Jew — how I hated their nasal voices and their oriental jewelry, and their noses and their wattles — what a snob I was: for they have immense vitality, and I think I like that quality best of all\" (Letter to Ethel Smythe 1930). These attitudes have been construed to reflect, not so much anti-semitism, but tribalism; she married outside her social grouping, and Leonard Woolf, too, expressed misgivings about marrying a gentile. Leonard, \"a penniless Jew from Putney\", lacked the material status of the Stephens and their circle.While travelling on a cruise to Portugal, she protested at finding \"a great many Portuguese Jews on board, and other repulsive objects, but we keep clear of them\". Furthermore, she wrote in her diary: \"I do not like the Jewish voice; I do not like the Jewish laugh.\" Her 1938 short story, The Duchess and the Jeweller (originally titled The Duchess and the Jew) has been considered anti-semitic.Yet Woolf and her husband Leonard came to despise and fear the 1930s fascism and antisemitism. Her 1938 book Three Guineas was an indictment of fascism and what Woolf described as a recurring propensity among patriarchal societies to enforce repressive societal mores by violence.\\n\\n\\n== Modern scholarship and interpretations ==\\nThough at least one biography of Virginia Woolf appeared in her lifetime, the first authoritative study of her life was published in 1972 by her nephew Quentin Bell. Hermione Lee\\'s 1996 biography Virginia Woolf provides a thorough and authoritative examination of Woolf\\'s life and work, which she discussed in an interview in 1997. In 2001, Louise DeSalvo and Mitchell A. Leaska edited The Letters of Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf. Julia Briggs\\'s Virginia Woolf: An Inner Life (2005) focuses on Woolf\\'s writing, including her novels and her commentary on the creative process, to illuminate her life. The sociologist Pierre Bourdieu also uses Woolf\\'s literature to understand and analyse gender domination. Woolf biographer Gillian Gill notes that Woolf\\'s traumatic experience of sexual abuse by her half-brothers during her childhood influenced her advocacy of protection of vulnerable children from similar experiences.\\n\\n\\n=== Virginia Woolf and her mother ===\\nThe intense scrutiny of Virginia Woolf\\'s literary output (see Bibliography) has inevitably led to speculation as to her mother\\'s influence, including psychoanalytic studies of mother and daughter. Woolf states that, \"my first memory, and in fact it is the most important of all my memories\" is of her mother. Her memories of her mother are memories of an obsession, starting with her first major breakdown on her mother\\'s death in 1895, the loss having a profound lifelong effect. In many ways, her mother\\'s profound influence on Virginia Woolf is conveyed in the latter\\'s recollections, \"there she is; beautiful, emphatic ... closer than any of the living are, lighting our random lives as with a burning torch, infinitely noble and delightful to her children\".Woolf described her mother as an \"invisible presence\" in her life, and Ellen Rosenman argues that the mother-daughter relationship is a constant in Woolf\\'s writing. She describes how Woolf\\'s modernism needs to be viewed in relationship to her ambivalence towards her Victorian mother, the centre of the former\\'s female identity, and her voyage to her own sense of autonomy. To Woolf, \"Saint Julia\" was both a martyr whose perfectionism was intimidating and a source of deprivation, by her absences real and virtual and premature death. Julia\\'s influence and memory pervades Woolf\\'s life and work. \"She has haunted me,\" she wrote.\\n\\n\\n=== Historical feminism ===\\n\"Recently, studies of Virginia Woolf have focused on feminist and lesbian themes in her work, such as in the 1997 collection of critical essays, Virginia Woolf: Lesbian Readings, edited by Eileen Barrett and Patricia Cramer.\" In 1928, Virginia Woolf took a grassroots approach to informing and inspiring feminism. She addressed undergraduate women at the ODTAA Society at Girton College, Cambridge and the Arts Society at Newnham College with two papers that eventually became A Room of One\\'s Own (1929). Woolf\\'s best-known nonfiction works, A Room of One\\'s Own (1929) and Three Guineas (1938), examine the difficulties that female writers and intellectuals faced because men held disproportionate legal and economic power, as well as the future of women in education and society, as the societal effects of industrialisation and birth control had not yet fully been realised.

       " {'Title': 'W. B. Yeats',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'William Butler Yeats (13 June 1865 – 28 January 1939) was an Irish poet and one of the foremost figures of 20th-century literature. A pillar of the Irish literary establishment, he helped to found the Abbey Theatre, and in his later years served two terms as a Senator of the Irish Free State. He was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival along with Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and others.\\nYeats was born in Sandymount, Ireland, and educated there and in London. He spent childhood holidays in County Sligo and studied poetry from an early age, when he became fascinated by Irish legends and the occult. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and realistic. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life. In 1923, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early years ===\\nWilliam Butler Yeats was born in Sandymount in County Dublin, Ireland. His father, John Butler Yeats (1839–1922), was a descendant of Jervis Yeats, a Williamite soldier, linen merchant, and well-known painter, who died in 1712. Benjamin Yeats, Jervis\\'s grandson and William\\'s great-great-grandfather, had in 1773 married Mary Butler of a landed family in County Kildare. Following their marriage, they kept the name Butler. Mary was of the Butler of Neigham (pronounced Nyam) Gowran family, descended from an illegitimate brother of the 8th Earl of Ormond.At the time of his marriage, William\\'s father, John Yeats, was studying law, but would later pursue art studies at Heatherley School of Fine Art, in London. William\\'s mother, Susan Mary Pollexfen, came from Sligo, from a wealthy merchant family, which owned a milling and shipping business. Soon after William\\'s birth, the family relocated to the Pollexfen home at Merville, Sligo, to stay with her extended family, and the young poet came to think of the area as his childhood and spiritual home. Its landscape became, over time, both literally and symbolically, his \"country of the heart\". So too did its location by the sea; John Yeats stated that \"by marriage with a Pollexfen, we have given a tongue to the sea cliffs\". The Butler Yeats family were highly artistic; his brother Jack became an esteemed painter, while his sisters Elizabeth and Susan Mary—known to family and friends as Lollie and Lily—became involved in the Arts and Crafts movement.Yeats was raised a member of the Protestant Ascendancy, which was at the time undergoing a crisis of identity. While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleon\\'s dictum that to understand the man you have to know what was happening in the world when he was twenty \"is manifestly true of W.B.Y.\" Yeats\\'s childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country\\'s biography.In 1867, the family moved to England to aid their father, John, to further his career as an artist. At first, the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales. John provided an erratic education in geography and chemistry and took William on natural history explorations of the nearby Slough countryside. On 26 January 1877, the young poet entered the Godolphin school, which he attended for four years. He did not distinguish himself academically, and an early school report describes his performance as \"only fair. Perhaps better in Latin than in any other subject. Very poor in spelling\". Though he had difficulty with mathematics and languages (possibly because he was tone deaf), he was fascinated by biology and zoology. In 1879 the family moved to Bedford Park taking a two-year lease on 8 Woodstock Road. For financial reasons, the family returned to Dublin toward the end of 1880, living at first in the suburbs of Harold\\'s Cross and later Howth. In October 1881, Yeats resumed his education at Dublin\\'s Erasmus Smith High School. His father\\'s studio was nearby and William spent a great deal of time there, where he met many of the city\\'s artists and writers. During this period he started writing poetry, and, in 1885, the Dublin University Review published Yeats\\'s first poems, as well as an essay entitled \"The Poetry of Sir Samuel Ferguson\". Between 1884 and 1886, William attended the Metropolitan School of Art—now the National College of Art and Design—in Thomas Street. In March 1888 the family moved to 3 Blenheim Road in Bedford Park. The rent on the house was £50 a year.He began writing his first works when he was seventeen; these included a poem—heavily influenced by Percy Bysshe Shelley—that describes a magician who set up a throne in central Asia. Other pieces from this period include a draft of a play about a bishop, a monk, and a woman accused of paganism by local shepherds, as well as love-poems and narrative lyrics on German knights. The early works were both conventional and, according to the critic Charles Johnston, \"utterly unIrish\", seeming to come out of a \"vast murmurous gloom of dreams\". Although Yeats\\'s early works drew heavily on Shelley, Edmund Spenser, and on the diction and colouring of pre-Raphaelite verse, he soon turned to Irish mythology and folklore and the writings of William Blake. In later life, Yeats paid tribute to Blake by describing him as one of the \"great artificers of God who uttered great truths to a little clan\". In 1891, Yeats published John Sherman and \"Dhoya\", one a novella, the other a story. The influence of Oscar Wilde is evident in Yeats\\'s theory of aesthetics, especially in his stage plays, and runs like a motif through his early works. The theory of masks, developed by Wilde in his polemic The Decay of Lying can clearly be seen in Yeats\\'s play The Player Queen, while the more sensual characterisation of Salomé, in Wilde\\'s play of the same name, provides the template for the changes Yeats made in his later plays, especially in On Baile\\'s Strand (1904), Deirdre (1907), and his dance play The King of the Great Clock Tower (1934).\\n\\n\\n=== Young poet ===\\n\\nThe family returned to London in 1887. In March 1890 Yeats joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and with Ernest Rhys co-founded the Rhymers\\' Club, a group of London-based poets who met regularly in a Fleet Street tavern to recite their verse. Yeats later sought to mythologize the collective, calling it the \"Tragic Generation\" in his autobiography, and published two anthologies of the Rhymers\\' work, the first one in 1892 and the second one in 1894. He collaborated with Edwin Ellis on the first complete edition of William Blake\\'s works, in the process rediscovering a forgotten poem, \"Vala, or, the Four Zoas\".Yeats had a lifelong interest in mysticism, spiritualism, occultism and astrology. He read extensively on the subjects throughout his life, became a member of the paranormal research organisation \"The Ghost Club\" (in 1911) and was especially influenced by the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. As early as 1892, he wrote: \"If I had not made magic my constant study I could not have written a single word of my Blake book, nor would The Countess Kathleen ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that I think and all that I write.\" His mystical interests—also inspired by a study of Hinduism, under the Theosophist Mohini Chatterjee, and the occult—formed much of the basis of his late poetry. Some critics disparaged this aspect of Yeats\\'s work.His first significant poem was \"The Island of Statues\", a fantasy work that took Edmund Spenser and Shelley for its poetic models. The piece was serialized in the Dublin University Review. Yeats wished to include it in his first collection, but it was deemed too long, and in fact, was never republished in his lifetime. Quinx Books published the poem in complete form for the first time in 2014. His first solo publication was the pamphlet Mosada: A Dramatic Poem (1886), which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems (1889), which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s. The long title poem contains, in the words of his biographer R. F. Foster, \"obscure Gaelic names, striking repetitions [and] an unremitting rhythm subtly varied as the poem proceeded through its three sections\":\\n\\n\"The Wanderings of Oisin\" is based on the lyrics of the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology and displays the influence of both Sir Samuel Ferguson and the Pre-Raphaelite poets. The poem took two years to complete and was one of the few works from this period that he did not disown in his maturity. Oisin introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include Poems (1895), The Secret Rose (1897), and The Wind Among the Reeds (1899). The covers of these volumes were illustrated by Yeats\\'s friend Althea Gyles.During 1885, Yeats was involved in the formation of the Dublin Hermetic Order. The society held its first meeting on 16 June, with Yeats acting as its chairman. The same year, the Dublin Theosophical lodge was opened in conjunction with Brahmin Mohini Chatterjee, who travelled from the Theosophical Society in London to lecture. Yeats attended his first séance the following year. He later became heavily involved with the Theosophy and with hermeticism, particularly with the eclectic Rosicrucianism of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. During séances held from 1912, a spirit calling itself \"Leo Africanus\" apparently claimed it was Yeats\\'s Daemon or anti-self, inspiring some of the speculations in Per Amica Silentia Lunae. He was admitted into the Golden Dawn in March 1890 and took the magical motto Daemon est Deus inversus—translated as \\'Devil is God inverted\\'. He was an active recruiter for the sect\\'s Isis-Urania Temple, and brought in his uncle George Pollexfen, Maud Gonne, and Florence Farr. Although he reserved a distaste for abstract and dogmatic religions founded around personality cults, he was attracted to the type of people he met at the Golden Dawn. He was involved in the Order\\'s power struggles, both with Farr and Macgregor Mathers, and was involved when Mathers sent Aleister Crowley to repossess Golden Dawn paraphernalia during the \"Battle of Blythe Road\". After the Golden Dawn ceased and splintered into various offshoots, Yeats remained with the Stella Matutina until 1921.\\n\\n\\n=== Maud Gonne ===\\n\\nIn 1889, Yeats met Maud Gonne, a 23-year-old English heiress and ardent Irish Nationalist. She was eighteen months younger than Yeats and later claimed she met the poet as a \"paint-stained art student.\" Gonne admired \"The Island of Statues\" and sought out his acquaintance. Yeats began an obsessive infatuation, and she had a significant and lasting effect on his poetry and his life thereafter. In later years he admitted, \"it seems to me that she [Gonne] brought into my life those days—for as yet I saw only what lay upon the surface—the middle of the tint, a sound as of a Burmese gong, an over-powering tumult that had yet many pleasant secondary notes.\" Yeats\\'s love was unrequited, in part due to his reluctance to participate in her nationalist activism.In 1891 he visited Gonne in Ireland and proposed marriage, but was rejected. He later admitted that from that point \"the troubling of my life began\". Yeats proposed to Gonne three more times: in 1899, 1900 and 1901. She refused each proposal, and in 1903, to his dismay, married the Irish nationalist Major John MacBride. His only other love affair during this period was with Olivia Shakespear, whom he first met in 1894, and parted from in 1897.\\n\\nYeats derided MacBride in letters and in poetry. He was horrified by Gonne\\'s marriage, at losing his muse to another man; in addition, her conversion to Catholicism before marriage offended him; Yeats was Protestant/agnostic. He worried his muse would come under the influence of the priests and do their bidding.Gonne\\'s marriage to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began to visit him in London. After the birth of her son, Seán MacBride, in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child\\'s welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main \\'second\\', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.\\n\\nYeats\\'s friendship with Gonne ended, yet, in Paris in 1908, they finally consummated their relationship. \"The long years of fidelity rewarded at last\" was how another of his lovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that \"the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul.\" The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: \"I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too.\" By January 1909, Gonne was sending Yeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain from sex. Nearly twenty years later, Yeats recalled the night with Gonne in his poem \"A Man Young and Old\":\\n\\nIn 1896, Yeats was introduced to Lady Gregory by their mutual friend Edward Martyn. Gregory encouraged Yeats\\'s nationalism and convinced him to continue focusing on writing drama. Although he was influenced by French Symbolism, Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors. Together with Lady Gregory, Martyn, and other writers including J. M. Synge, Seán O\\'Casey, and Padraic Colum, Yeats was one of those responsible for the establishment of the \"Irish Literary Revival\" movement. Apart from these creative writers, much of the impetus for the Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was Douglas Hyde, later the first President of Ireland, whose Love Songs of Connacht was widely admired.\\n\\n\\n=== Abbey Theatre ===\\n\\nIn 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and George Moore began the Irish Literary Theatre to present Irish plays. The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre, which sought to express the \"ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager à l\\'anglais.\" The group\\'s manifesto, which Yeats wrote, declared, \"We hope to find in Ireland an uncorrupted & imaginative audience trained to listen by its passion for oratory ... & that freedom to experiment which is not found in the theatres of England, & without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed.\"The collective survived for about two years but was not successful. Working with two Irish brothers with theatrical experience, William and Frank Fay, Yeats\\'s unpaid yet independently wealthy secretary Annie Horniman, and the leading West End actress Florence Farr, the group established the Irish National Theatre Society. Along with Synge, they acquired property in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the Abbey Theatre. Yeats\\'s play Cathleen ni Houlihan and Lady Gregory\\'s Spreading the News were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death, both as a member of the board and a prolific playwright. In 1902, he helped set up the Dun Emer Press to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the Cuala Press in 1904, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, sought to \"find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things.\" From then until its closure in 1946, the press—which was run by the poet\\'s sisters—produced over 70 titles; 48 of them books by Yeats himself.\\nYeats met the American poet Ezra Pound in 1909. Pound had travelled to London at least partly to meet the older man, whom he considered \"the only poet worthy of serious study.\" From that year until 1916, the two men wintered in the Stone Cottage at Ashdown Forest, with Pound nominally acting as Yeats\\'s secretary. The relationship got off to a rocky start when Pound arranged for the publication in the magazine Poetry of some of Yeats\\'s verse with Pound\\'s own unauthorised alterations. These changes reflected Pound\\'s distaste for Victorian prosody. A more indirect influence was the scholarship on Japanese Noh plays that Pound had obtained from Ernest Fenollosa\\'s widow, which provided Yeats with a model for the aristocratic drama he intended to write. The first of his plays modelled on Noh was At the Hawk\\'s Well, the first draft of which he dictated to Pound in January 1916.The emergence of a nationalist revolutionary movement from the ranks of the mostly Roman Catholic lower-middle and working class made Yeats reassess some of his attitudes. In the refrain of \"Easter, 1916\" (\"All changed, changed utterly / A terrible beauty is born\"), Yeats faces his own failure to recognise the merits of the leaders of the Easter Rising, due to his attitude towards their ordinary backgrounds and lives.Yeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park, Co, Galway. He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, \"The Wild Swans at Coole\" was written there, between 1916 and 1917.\\nHe wrote prefaces for two books of Irish mythological tales, compiled by Augusta, Lady Gregory: Cuchulain of Muirthemne (1902), and Gods and Fighting Men (1904). In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \"One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Politics ===\\nYeats was an Irish Nationalist, who sought a kind of traditional lifestyle articulated through poems such as \\'The Fisherman\\'. However, as his life progressed, he sheltered much of his revolutionary spirit and distanced himself from the intense political landscape until 1922, when he was appointed Senator for the Irish Free State.In the earlier part of his life, Yeats was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Due to the escalating tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the Easter Rising, even holding back his poetry inspired by the events until 1920.\\nIn the 1930s Yeats was fascinated with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, nationalist movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the Blueshirts, although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership. D. P. Moran called him a minor poet and \"crypto-Protestant conman.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Marriage to Georgie Hyde Lees ===\\n\\nBy 1916, Yeats was 51 years old and determined to marry and produce an heir. His rival John MacBride had been executed for his role in the 1916 Easter Rising, so Yeats hoped that his widow might remarry. His final proposal to Maud Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonne\\'s history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few years of her life—including chloroform addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife; biographer R. F. Foster has observed that Yeats\\'s last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.\\nYeats proposed in an indifferent manner, with conditions attached, and he both expected and hoped she would turn him down. According to Foster, \"when he duly asked Maud to marry him and was duly refused, his thoughts shifted with surprising speed to her daughter.\" Iseult Gonne was Maud\\'s second child with Lucien Millevoye, and at the time was twenty-one years old. She had lived a sad life to this point; conceived as an attempt to reincarnate her short-lived brother, for the first few years of her life she was presented as her mother\\'s adopted niece. When Maud told her that she was going to marry, Iseult cried and told her mother that she hated MacBride. When Gonne took action to divorce MacBride in 1905, the court heard allegations that he had sexually assaulted Iseult, then eleven. At fifteen, she proposed to Yeats. In 1917, he proposed to Iseult but was rejected.\\nThat September, Yeats proposed to 25-year-old Georgie Hyde-Lees (1892–1968), known as George, whom he had met through Olivia Shakespear. Despite warnings from her friends—\"George ... you can\\'t. He must be dead\"—Hyde-Lees accepted, and the two were married on 20 October. Their marriage was a success, in spite of the age difference, and in spite of Yeats\\'s feelings of remorse and regret during their honeymoon. The couple went on to have two children, Anne and Michael. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband \"When you are dead, people will talk about your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were.\"During the first years of marriage, they experimented with automatic writing; she contacted a variety of spirits and guides they called \"Instructors\" while in a trance. The spirits communicated a complex and esoteric system of philosophy and history, which the couple developed into an exposition using geometrical shapes: phases, cones, and gyres. Yeats devoted much time to preparing this material for publication as A Vision (1925). In 1924, he wrote to his publisher T. Werner Laurie, admitting: \"I dare say I delude myself in thinking this book my book of books\".\\n\\n\\n=== Nobel Prize ===\\n\\nIn December 1923, Yeats was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for his always inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation\". He was aware of the symbolic value of an Irish winner so soon after Ireland had gained independence, and sought to highlight the fact at each available opportunity. His reply to many of the letters of congratulations sent to him contained the words: \"I consider that this honour has come to me less as an individual than as a representative of Irish literature, it is part of Europe\\'s welcome to the Free State.\"Yeats used the occasion of his acceptance lecture at the Royal Academy of Sweden to present himself as a standard-bearer of Irish nationalism and Irish cultural independence. As he remarked, \"The theatres of Dublin were empty buildings hired by the English travelling companies, and we wanted Irish plays and Irish players. When we thought of these plays we thought of everything that was romantic and poetical because the nationalism we had called up—the nationalism every generation had called up in moments of discouragement—was romantic and poetical.\" The prize led to a significant increase in the sales of his books, as his publishers Macmillan sought to capitalise on the publicity. For the first time he had money, and he was able to repay not only his own debts but those of his father.\\n\\n\\n=== Old age and death ===\\nBy early 1925, Yeats\\'s health had stabilised, and he had completed most of the writing for A Vision (dated 1925, it actually appeared in January 1926, when he almost immediately started rewriting it for a second version). He had been appointed to the first Irish Senate in 1922, and was re-appointed for a second term in 1925. Early in his tenure, a debate on divorce arose, and Yeats viewed the issue as primarily a confrontation between the emerging Roman Catholic ethos and the Protestant minority. When the Roman Catholic Church weighed in with a blanket refusal to consider their anti position, The Irish Times countered that a measure to outlaw divorce would alienate Protestants and \"crystallise\" the partition of Ireland.\\nIn response, Yeats delivered a series of speeches that attacked the \"quixotically impressive\" ambitions of the government and clergy, likening their campaign tactics to those of \"medieval Spain.\" \"Marriage is not to us a Sacrament, but, upon the other hand, the love of a man and woman, and the inseparable physical desire, are sacred. This conviction has come to us through ancient philosophy and modern literature, and it seems to us a most sacrilegious thing to persuade two people who hate each other... to live together, and it is to us no remedy to permit them to part if neither can re-marry.\" The resulting debate has been described as one of Yeats\\'s \"supreme public moments\", and began his ideological move away from pluralism towards religious confrontation.\\n\\nHis language became more forceful; the Jesuit Father Peter Finlay was described by Yeats as a man of \"monstrous discourtesy\", and he lamented that \"It is one of the glories of the Church in which I was born that we have put our Bishops in their place in discussions requiring legislation\". During his time in the Senate, Yeats further warned his colleagues: \"If you show that this country, southern Ireland, is going to be governed by Roman Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone, you will never get the North... You will put a wedge in the midst of this nation\". He memorably said of his fellow Irish Protestants, \"we are no petty people\".\\n\\nIn 1924, he chaired a coinage committee charged with selecting a set of designs for the first currency of the Irish Free State. Aware of the symbolic power latent in the imagery of a young state\\'s currency, he sought a form that was \"elegant, racy of the soil, and utterly unpolitical\". When the house finally decided on the artwork of Percy Metcalfe, Yeats was pleased, though he regretted that compromise had led to \"lost muscular tension\" in the finally depicted images. He retired from the Senate in 1928 because of ill health.\\nTowards the end of his life—and especially after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and Great Depression, which led some to question whether democracy could cope with deep economic difficulty—Yeats seems to have returned to his aristocratic sympathies. During the aftermath of the First World War, he became sceptical about the efficacy of democratic government, and anticipated political reconstruction in Europe through totalitarian rule. His later association with Pound drew him towards Benito Mussolini, for whom he expressed admiration on a number of occasions. He wrote three \"marching songs\"—never used—for the Irish General Eoin O\\'Duffy\\'s Blueshirts.\\nAt the age of 69 he was \\'rejuvenated\\' by the Steinach operation which was performed on 6 April 1934 by Norman Haire. For the last five years of his life Yeats found a new vigour evident from both his poetry and his intimate relations with younger women. During this time, Yeats was involved in a number of romantic affairs with, among others, the poet and actress Margot Ruddock, and the novelist, journalist and sexual radical Ethel Mannin. As in his earlier life, Yeats found erotic adventure conducive to his creative energy, and, despite age and ill-health, he remained a prolific writer. In a letter of 1935, Yeats noted: \"I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation has given me, the ferment that has come upon my imagination. If I write poetry it will be unlike anything I have done\". In 1936, he undertook editorship of the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892–1935.He died at the Hôtel Idéal Séjour, in Menton, France, on 28 January 1939, aged 73. He was buried after a discreet and private funeral at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. Attempts had been made at Roquebrune to dissuade the family from proceeding with the removal of the remains to Ireland due to the uncertainty of their identity. His body had earlier been exhumed and transferred to the ossuary. Yeats and George had often discussed his death, and his express wish was that he be buried quickly in France with a minimum of fuss. According to George, \"His actual words were \\'If I die, bury me up there [at Roquebrune] and then in a year\\'s time when the newspapers have forgotten me, dig me up and plant me in Sligo\\'.\" In September 1948, Yeats\\'s body was moved to the churchyard of St Columba\\'s Church, Drumcliff, County Sligo, on the Irish Naval Service corvette LÉ Macha. The person in charge of this operation for the Irish Government was Seán MacBride, son of Maud Gonne MacBride, and then Minister of External Affairs.\\n\\nHis epitaph is taken from the last lines of \"Under Ben Bulben\", one of his final poems:\\n\\nFrench ambassador Stanislas Ostroróg was involved in returning the remains of the poet from France to Ireland in 1948; in a letter to the European director of the Foreign Ministry in Paris, \"Ostrorog tells how Yeats\\'s son Michael sought official help in locating the poet\\'s remains. Neither Michael Yeats nor Sean MacBride, the Irish foreign minister who organised the ceremony, wanted to know the details of how the remains were collected, Ostrorog notes. He repeatedly urges caution and discretion and says the Irish ambassador in Paris should not be informed.\" Yeats\\'s body was exhumed in 1946 and the remains were moved to an ossuary and mixed with other remains. The French Foreign Ministry authorized Ostrorog to secretly cover the cost of repatriation from his slush fund. Authorities were worried about the fact that the much-loved poet\\'s remains were thrown into a communal grave, causing embarrassment for both Ireland and France. Per a letter from Ostroróg to his superiors, \"Mr Rebouillat, (a) forensic doctor in Roquebrune would be able to reconstitute a skeleton presenting all the characteristics of the deceased.\"\\n\\n\\n== Style ==\\n\\nYeats is considered one of the key twentieth-century English-language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.Unlike other modernists who experimented with free verse, Yeats was a master of the traditional forms. The impact of modernism on his work can be seen in the increasing abandonment of the more conventionally poetic diction of his early work in favour of the more austere language and more direct approach to his themes that increasingly characterises the poetry and plays of his middle period, comprising the volumes In the Seven Woods, Responsibilities and The Green Helmet. His later poetry and plays are written in a more personal vein, and the works written in the last twenty years of his life include mention of his son and daughter, as well as meditations on the experience of growing old. In his poem, \"The Circus Animals\\' Desertion\", he describes the inspiration for these late works:\\n\\nDuring 1929, he stayed at Thoor Ballylee near Gort in County Galway (where Yeats had his summer home since 1919) for the last time. Much of the remainder of his life was lived outside Ireland, although he did lease Riversdale house in the Dublin suburb of Rathfarnham in 1932. He wrote prolifically through his final years, and published poetry, plays, and prose. In 1938, he attended the Abbey for the final time to see the premiere of his play Purgatory. His Autobiographies of William Butler Yeats was published that same year. In 1913, Yeats wrote the preface for the English translation of Rabindranath Tagore\\'s Gitanjali (Song Offering) for which Tagore received the Nobel Prize in literature.\\n\\nWhile Yeats\\'s early poetry drew heavily on Irish myth and folklore, his later work was engaged with more contemporary issues, and his style underwent a dramatic transformation. His work can be divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as The Isle of Statues and The Wanderings of Oisin. His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats\\'s middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work and attempt to turn himself into a Landor-style social ironist.Critics who admire his middle work might characterize it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats\\'s later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system he began to work out for himself under the influence of spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly-minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.Some critics claim that Yeats spanned the transition from the nineteenth century into twentieth-century modernism in poetry much as Pablo Picasso did in painting while others question whether late Yeats has much in common with modernists of the Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot variety.Modernists read the well-known poem \"The Second Coming\" as a dirge for the decline of European civilisation, but it also expresses Yeats\\'s apocalyptic mystical theories and is shaped by the 1890s. His most important collections of poetry started with The Green Helmet (1910) and Responsibilities (1914). In imagery, Yeats\\'s poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. The Tower (1928), The Winding Stair (1933), and New Poems (1938) contained some of the most potent images in twentieth-century poetry.Yeats\\'s mystical inclinations, informed by Hinduism, theosophical beliefs and the occult, provided much of the basis of his late poetry, which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual credibility. The metaphysics of Yeats\\'s late works must be read in relation to his system of esoteric fundamentals in A Vision (1925).\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nYeats is commemorated in Sligo town by a statue, created in 1989 by sculptor Rowan Gillespie. On the 50th anniversary of the poet\\'s death, it was erected outside the Ulster Bank, at the corner of Stephen Street and Markievicz Road. Yeats had remarked on receiving his Nobel Prize that the Royal Palace in Stockholm \"resembled the Ulster Bank in Sligo\". Across the river is the Yeats Memorial Building, home to the Sligo Yeats Society. Standing Figure: Knife Edge by Henry Moore is displayed in the W. B. Yeats Memorial Garden at St Stephen\\'s Green in Dublin.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Sources ==\\nDoody, Noreen (2018). The Influence of Oscar Wilde on W. B.

       " {'Title': 'T. S. Eliot',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'Thomas Stearns Eliot  (26 September 1888 – 4 January 1965) was a poet, essayist, publisher, playwright, literary critic and editor. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, to a prominent Boston Brahmin family, he moved to England in 1914 at the age of 25 and went on to settle, work and marry there. He became a British subject in 1927 at the age of 39, subsequently renouncing his American citizenship.Considered one of the 20th century\\'s major poets, Eliot attracted widespread attention for his poem \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" (1915), which was seen as a masterpiece of the Modernist movement. It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including \"The Waste Land\" (1922), \"The Hollow Men\" (1925), \"Ash Wednesday\" (1930), and Four Quartets (1943). He was also known for his seven plays, particularly Murder in the Cathedral (1935) and The Cocktail Party (1949). He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1948, \"for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry\".\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and education ===\\nThe Eliots were a Boston Brahmin family with roots in England and New England. Eliot\\'s paternal grandfather, William Greenleaf Eliot, had moved to St. Louis, Missouri, to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, Henry Ware Eliot (1843–1919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, Charlotte Champe Stearns (1843–1929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\\nEliot\\'s childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double inguinal hernia, he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or Mark Twain\\'s thrill-seeking Tom Sawyer. In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\" Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one\\'s childhood beside the big river, which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"From 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended Smith Academy, the boys college preparatory division of Washington University, where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of Edward Fitzgerald\\'s translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. He said the results were gloomy and despairing and he destroyed them. His first published poem, \"A Fable For Feasters\", was written as a school exercise and was published in the Smith Academy Record in February 1905. Also published there in April 1905 was his oldest surviving poem in manuscript, an untitled lyric, later revised and reprinted as \"Song\" in The Harvard Advocate, Harvard University\\'s student magazine. He also published three short stories in 1905, \"Birds of Prey\", \"A Tale of a Whale\" and \"The Man Who Was King\". The last mentioned story significantly reflects his exploration of the Igorot Village while visiting the 1904 World\\'s Fair of St. Louis. Such a link with Indigenous peoples importantly antedates his anthropological studies at Harvard.Eliot lived in St. Louis, Missouri for the first sixteen years of his life at the house on Locust St. where he was born. After going away to school in 1905, he only returned to St. Louis for vacations and visits. Despite moving away from the city, Eliot wrote to a friend that the \"Missouri and the Mississippi have made a deeper impression on me than any other part of the world.\"Following graduation, Eliot attended Milton Academy in Massachusetts for a preparatory year, where he met Scofield Thayer who later published The Waste Land. He studied philosophy at Harvard College from 1906 to 1909, earning a B.A. in 1909 and a M.A. the following year. Because of his year at Milton Academy, Eliot was allowed to take a B.A. after three years instead of the usual four. While a student at Harvard, Eliot was placed on academic probation and graduated with a pass degree (i.e. no honours). His B.A. was in an elective program best described as comparative literature, and his M.A. English Literature. Frank Kermode writes that the most important moment of Eliot\\'s undergraduate career was in 1908 when he discovered Arthur Symons\\'s The Symbolist Movement in Literature. This introduced him to Jules Laforgue, Arthur Rimbaud, and Paul Verlaine. Without Verlaine, Eliot wrote, he might never have heard of Tristan Corbière and his book Les amours jaunes, a work that affected the course of Eliot\\'s life. The Harvard Advocate published some of his poems and he became lifelong friends with Conrad Aiken, the American writer and critic.\\nAfter working as a philosophy assistant at Harvard from 1909 to 1910, Eliot moved to Paris where, from 1910 to 1911, he studied philosophy at the Sorbonne. He attended lectures by Henri Bergson and read poetry with Henri Alban-Fournier. From 1911 to 1914, he was back at Harvard studying Indian philosophy and Sanskrit. Whilst a member of the Harvard Graduate School, Eliot met and fell in love with Emily Hale.   Eliot was awarded a scholarship to Merton College, Oxford, in 1914. He first visited Marburg, Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the First World War broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the Junior Common Room proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the Americanization of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.Eliot wrote to Conrad Aiken on New Year\\'s Eve 1914: \"I hate university towns and university people, who are the same everywhere, with pregnant wives, sprawling children, many books and hideous pictures on the walls ... Oxford is very pretty, but I don\\'t like to be dead.\" Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure Ezra Pound. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound\\'s flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot\\'s beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\" In the end, Eliot did not settle at Merton and left after a year. In 1915 he taught English at Birkbeck, University of London.\\nBy 1916, he had completed a doctoral dissertation for Harvard on \"Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of F. H. Bradley\", but he failed to return for the viva voce exam.\\n\\n\\n=== Marriage ===\\n\\nBefore leaving the US, Eliot had told Emily Hale that he was in love with her; he exchanged letters with her from Oxford during 1914 and 1915 but they did not meet again until 1927. In a letter to Aiken late in December 1914, Eliot, aged 26, wrote, \"I am very dependent upon women (I mean female society).\" Less than four months later, Thayer introduced Eliot to Vivienne Haigh-Wood, a Cambridge governess. They were married at Hampstead Register Office on 26 June 1915.After a short visit alone to his family in the United States, Eliot returned to London and took several teaching jobs, such as lecturing at Birkbeck College, University of London. The philosopher Bertrand Russell took an interest in Vivienne while the newlyweds stayed in his flat. Some scholars have suggested that she and Russell had an affair, but the allegations were never confirmed.The marriage was markedly unhappy, in part because of Vivienne\\'s health problems. In a letter addressed to Ezra Pound, she covers an extensive list of her symptoms, which included a habitually high temperature, fatigue, insomnia, migraines, and colitis. This, coupled with apparent mental instability, meant that she was often sent away by Eliot and her doctors for extended periods of time in the hope of improving her health, and as time went on, he became increasingly detached from her. The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne\\'s brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play Tom & Viv, which in 1994 was adapted as a film of the same name.\\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of mind out of which came The Waste Land.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Teaching, banking, and publishing ===\\n\\nAfter leaving Merton, Eliot worked as a schoolteacher, most notably at Highgate School, a private school in London, where he taught French and Latin—his students included the young John Betjeman. Later he taught at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, a state school in Buckinghamshire. To earn extra money, he wrote book reviews and lectured at evening extension courses at the University College London, and Oxford. In 1917, he took a position at Lloyds Bank in London, working on foreign accounts. On a trip to Paris in August 1920 with the artist Wyndham Lewis, he met the writer James Joyce. Eliot said he found Joyce arrogant—Joyce doubted Eliot\\'s ability as a poet at the time—but the two soon became friends, with Eliot visiting Joyce whenever he was in Paris. Eliot and Wyndham Lewis also maintained a close friendship, leading to Lewis\\'s later making his well-known portrait painting of Eliot in 1938.\\nCharles Whibley recommended T.S. Eliot to Geoffrey Faber. In 1925 Eliot left Lloyds to become a director in the publishing firm Faber and Gwyer, later Faber and Faber, where he remained for the rest of his career. At Faber and Faber, he was responsible for publishing important English poets like W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and Ted Hughes.\\n\\n\\n=== Conversion to Anglicanism and British citizenship ===\\n\\nOn 29 June 1927, Eliot converted to Anglicanism from Unitarianism, and in November that year he took British citizenship. He became a warden of his parish church, St Stephen\\'s, Gloucester Road, London, and a life member of the Society of King Charles the Martyr. He specifically identified as Anglo-Catholic, proclaiming himself \"classicist in literature, royalist in politics, and anglo-catholic  [sic] in religion\". About 30 years later Eliot commented on his religious views that he combined \"a Catholic cast of mind, a Calvinist heritage, and a Puritanical temperament\". He also had wider spiritual interests, commenting that \"I see the path of progress for modern man in his occupation with his own self, with his inner being\" and citing  Goethe and Rudolf Steiner as exemplars of such a direction.One of Eliot\\'s biographers, Peter Ackroyd, commented that \"the purposes of [Eliot\\'s conversion] were two-fold. One: the Church of England offered Eliot some hope for himself, and I think Eliot needed some resting place. But secondly, it attached Eliot to the English community and English culture.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Separation and remarriage ===\\nBy 1932, Eliot had been contemplating a separation from his wife for some time. When Harvard offered him the Charles Eliot Norton professorship for the 1932–1933 academic year, he accepted and left Vivienne in England. Upon his return, he arranged for a formal separation from her, avoiding all but one meeting with her between his leaving for America in 1932 and her death in 1947. Vivienne was committed to the Northumberland House mental hospital, Stoke Newington, in 1938, and remained there until she died. Although Eliot was still legally her husband, he never visited her. From 1933 to 1946 Eliot had a close emotional relationship with Emily Hale. Eliot later destroyed Hale\\'s letters to him, but Hale donated Eliot\\'s to Princeton University Library where they were sealed until 2020. When Eliot heard of the donation he deposited his own account of their relationship with Harvard University to be opened whenever the Princeton letters were.From 1938 to 1957 Eliot\\'s public companion was Mary Trevelyan of London University, who wanted to marry him and left a detailed memoir.From 1946 to 1957, Eliot shared a flat at 19 Carlyle Mansions, Chelsea, with his friend John Davy Hayward, who collected and managed Eliot\\'s papers, styling himself \"Keeper of the Eliot Archive\". Hayward also collected Eliot\\'s pre-Prufrock verse, commercially published after Eliot\\'s death as Poems Written in Early Youth. When Eliot and Hayward separated their household in 1957, Hayward retained his collection of Eliot\\'s papers, which he bequeathed to King\\'s College, Cambridge, in 1965.\\nOn 10 January 1957, at the age of 68, Eliot married Esmé Valerie Fletcher, who was 30. In contrast to his first marriage, Eliot knew Fletcher well, as she had been his secretary at Faber and Faber since August 1949. They kept their wedding secret; the ceremony was held in St. Barnabas\\' Church, Kensington, London, at 6:15 am with virtually no one in attendance other than his wife\\'s parents. Eliot had no children with either of his wives. In the early 1960s, by then in failing health, Eliot worked as an editor for the Wesleyan University Press, seeking new poets in Europe for publication. After Eliot\\'s death, Valerie dedicated her time to preserving his legacy, by editing and annotating The Letters of T. S. Eliot and a facsimile of the draft of The Waste Land. Valerie Eliot died on 9 November 2012 at her home in London.\\n\\n\\n=== Death and honours ===\\n\\nEliot died of emphysema at his home in Kensington in London, on 4 January 1965, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were taken to St Michael and All Angels\\' Church, East Coker, the village in Somerset from which his Eliot ancestors had emigrated to America. A wall plaque in the church commemorates him with a quotation from his poem East Coker: \"In my beginning is my end. In my end is my beginning.\"In 1967, on the second anniversary of his death, Eliot was commemorated by the placement of a large stone in the floor of Poets\\' Corner in London\\'s Westminster Abbey. The stone, cut by designer Reynolds Stone, is inscribed with his life dates, his Order of Merit, and a quotation from his poem Little Gidding, \"the communication / of the dead is tongued with fire beyond / the language of the living.\"The apartment block where he died, No. 3 Kensington Court Gardens, has had a blue plaque on it since 1986.\\n\\n\\n== Poetry ==\\nFor a poet of his stature, Eliot produced a relatively small number of poems. He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"Typically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was Prufrock and Other Observations (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in Ara Vos Prec (London) and Poems: 1920 (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected The Waste Land and the poems in Prufrock and Poems into one volume and added The Hollow Men to form Poems: 1909–1925. From then on, he updated this work as Collected Poems. Exceptions are Old Possum\\'s Book of Practical Cats (1939), a collection of light verse; Poems Written in Early Youth, posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in The Harvard Advocate, and Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909–1917, material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.During an interview in 1959, Eliot said of his nationality and its role in his work: \"I\\'d say that my poetry has obviously more in common with my distinguished contemporaries in America than with anything written in my generation in England. That I\\'m sure of. ... It wouldn\\'t be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn\\'t be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn\\'t be what it is if I\\'d been born in England, and it wouldn\\'t be what it is if I\\'d stayed in America. It\\'s a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America.\"Cleo McNelly Kearns notes in her biography that Eliot was deeply influenced by Indic traditions, notably the Upanishads. From the Sanskrit ending of The Waste Land to the \"What Krishna meant\" section of Four Quartets shows how much Indic religions and more specifically Hinduism made up his philosophical basic for his thought process. It must also be acknowledged, as Chinmoy Guha showed in his book Where the Dreams Cross: T S Eliot and French Poetry (Macmillan, 2011) that he was deeply influenced by French poets from Baudelaire to Paul Valéry. He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats: \"The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice did not exist in English at all; it was only to be found in French.\" (\"Yeats\", On Poetry and Poets, 1948).\\n\\n\\n=== \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" ===\\n\\nIn 1915, Ezra Pound, overseas editor of Poetry magazine, recommended to Harriet Monroe, the magazine\\'s founder, that she publish \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\". Although the character Prufrock seems to be middle-aged, Eliot wrote most of the poem when he was only twenty-two. Its now-famous opening lines, comparing the evening sky to \"a patient etherised upon a table\", were considered shocking and offensive, especially at a time when Georgian Poetry was hailed for its derivations of the nineteenth century Romantic Poets.The poem\\'s structure was heavily influenced by Eliot\\'s extensive reading of Dante and refers to a number of literary works, including Hamlet and those of the French Symbolists. Its reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in The Times Literary Supplement on 21 June 1917. \"The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone, even to himself. They certainly have no relation to poetry.\"\\n\\n\\n=== \"The Waste Land\" ===\\n\\nIn October 1922, Eliot published \"The Waste Land\" in The Criterion. Eliot\\'s dedication to il miglior fabbro (\"the better craftsman\") refers to Ezra Pound\\'s significant hand in editing and reshaping the poem from a longer Eliot manuscript to the shortened version that appears in publication.It was composed during a period of personal difficulty for Eliot—his marriage was failing, and both he and Vivienne were suffering from nervous disorders. Before the poem\\'s publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to Richard Aldington, saying, \"As for The Waste Land, that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\" The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called The Waste Land, some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed ‘the disillusion of a generation’, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"The poem is known for its obscure nature—its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of modern literature, a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, James Joyce\\'s Ulysses.Among its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and \"Shantih shantih shantih\". The Sanskrit mantra ends the poem.\\n\\n\\n=== \"The Hollow Men\" ===\\n\\n\"The Hollow Men\" appeared in 1925. For the critic Edmund Wilson, it marked \"The nadir of the phase of despair and desolation given such effective expression in \"The Waste Land\".\" It is Eliot\\'s major poem of the late 1920s. Similar to Eliot\\'s other works, its themes are overlapping and fragmentary. Post-war Europe under the Treaty of Versailles (which Eliot despised), the difficulty of hope and religious conversion, Eliot\\'s failed marriage.\\nAllen Tate perceived a shift in Eliot\\'s method, writing, \"The mythologies disappear altogether in \\'The Hollow Men\\'.\" This is a striking claim for a poem as indebted to Dante as anything else in Eliot\\'s early work, to say little of the modern English mythology—the \"Old Guy Fawkes\" of the Gunpowder Plot—or the colonial and agrarian mythos of Joseph Conrad and James George Frazer, which, at least for reasons of textual history, echo in The Waste Land. The \"continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity\" that is so characteristic of his mythical method remained in fine form. \"The Hollow Men\" contains some of Eliot\\'s most famous lines, notably its conclusion: This is the way the world endsNot with a bang but a whimper.\\n\\n\\n=== \"Ash-Wednesday\" ===\\n\\n\"Ash-Wednesday\" is the first long poem written by Eliot after his 1927 conversion to Anglicanism. Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when a person who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot\\'s \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human salvation. Eliot\\'s style of writing in \"Ash-Wednesday\" showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot\\'s subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.Many critics were particularly enthusiastic about \"Ash-Wednesday\". Edwin Muir maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem\\'s groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular literati.\\n\\n\\n=== Old Possum\\'s Book of Practical Cats ===\\n\\nIn 1939, Eliot published a book of light verse, Old Possum\\'s Book of Practical Cats (\"Old Possum\" was Ezra Pound\\'s nickname for him). This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer Alan Rawsthorne set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled Practical Cats. After Eliot\\'s death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical Cats by Andrew Lloyd Webber, first produced in London\\'s West End in 1981 and opening on Broadway the following year.\\n\\n\\n=== Four Quartets ===\\n\\nEliot regarded Four Quartets as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: \"Burnt Norton\" (1936), \"East Coker\" (1940), \"The Dry Salvages\" (1941) and \"Little Gidding\" (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect—theological, historical, physical—and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four classical elements, respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\\n\"Burnt Norton\" is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds such as the bird, the roses, clouds and an empty pool. The meditation leads the narrator to reach \"the still point\" in which there is no attempt to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet\\'s art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\\n\"East Coker\" continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\\n\"The Dry Salvages\" treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\\n\"Little Gidding\" (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the Quartets. Eliot\\'s experiences as an air raid warden in the Blitz power the poem, and he imagines meeting Dante during the German bombing. The beginning of the Quartets (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of Julian of Norwich: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing shall be well.\"\\nThe Four Quartets cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics St. John of the Cross and Julian of Norwich. The \"deeper communion\" sought in \"East Coker\", the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim\\'s path along the road of sanctification.\\n\\n\\n== Plays ==\\n\\nWith the important exception of Four Quartets, Eliot directed much of his creative energies after Ash Wednesday to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of Elizabethan and Jacobean verse drama; witness his allusions to Webster, Thomas Middleton, William Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd in The Waste Land. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"After The Waste Land (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early jazz. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled Fragment of a Prologue (1926) and Fragment of an Agon (1927), were published together in 1932 as Sweeney Agonistes. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.A pageant play by Eliot called The Rock was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the Diocese of London. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses. George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester, had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer E. Martin Browne for the production of The Rock, and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the Canterbury Festival in 1935. This one, Murder in the Cathedral, concerning the death of the martyr, Thomas Becket, was more under Eliot\\'s control. Eliot biographer Peter Ackroyd comments that \"for [Eliot], Murder in the Cathedral and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\" After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: The Family Reunion (1939), The Cocktail Party (1949), The Confidential Clerk, (1953) and The Elder Statesman (1958) (the latter three were produced by Henry Sherek and directed by E. Martin Browne). The Broadway production in New York of The Cocktail Party received the 1950 Tony Award for Best Play. Eliot wrote The Cocktail Party while he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study.Regarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, \"If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"\\n\\n\\n== Literary criticism ==\\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of literary criticism, strongly influencing the school of New Criticism. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic William Empson once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"In his critical essay \"Tradition and the Individual Talent\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\" This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist\\'s previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem The Waste Land.Also important to New Criticism was the idea—as articulated in Eliot\\'s essay \"Hamlet and His Problems\"—of an \"objective correlative\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences. This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers\\' different—but perhaps corollary—interpretations of a work.\\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"\\'classical\\' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially Shelley; his proposition that good poems constitute \\'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion\\'; and his insistence that \\'poets... at present must be difficult\\'.\"Eliot\\'s essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the metaphysical poets. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets\\' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with—in Eliot\\'s view—wit and uniqueness. Eliot\\'s essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".His 1922 poem The Waste Land also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot\\'s critical lens, The Waste Land likely shows his personal despair about World War I rather than an objective historical understanding of it.Late in his career, Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing, in essays such as \"Poetry and Drama\", \"Hamlet and his Problems\", and \"The Possibility of a Poetic Drama\", focused on the aesthetics of writing drama in verse.\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Responses to his poetry ===\\nThe writer Ronald Bush notes that Eliot\\'s early poems like \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot\\'s] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at \\'how sharp and complete and sui generis the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.\\'\"The initial critical response to Eliot\\'s The Waste Land was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation—and, like 1920s jazz, essentially iconoclastic.\" Some critics, like Edmund Wilson, Conrad Aiken, and Gilbert Seldes thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\". Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot\\'s weaknesses as a poet. In regard to The Waste Land, Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"Charles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible. And the writers of Time magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like The Waste Land. John Crowe Ransom wrote negative criticisms of Eliot\\'s work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised The Waste Land for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot\\'s work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.Addressing some of the common criticisms directed against The Waste Land at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"\\nEliot\\'s reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of The Four Quartets. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer Cynthia Ozick refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\". But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot\\'s literary influence: As Eliot\\'s conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in Four Quartets and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot\\'s occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation. Bush also notes that Eliot\\'s reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic (William Carlos Williams\\'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening neoclassicism (as he himself—perhaps just as unfairly—had criticized Milton). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"Although Eliot\\'s poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like Harold Bloom and Stephen Greenblatt, still acknowledge that Eliot\\'s poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of The Norton Anthology of English Literature write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot\\'s] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot\\'s] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as the poet of the modern symbolist-Metaphysical tradition\".\\n\\n\\n=== Anti-Semitism ===\\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot\\'s poems has led several critics to accuse him of anti-Semitism. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by Anthony Julius: T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form (1996). In \"Gerontion\", Eliot writes, in the voice of the poem\\'s elderly narrator, \"And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner [of my building] / Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp.\" Another well-known example appears in the poem, \"Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar\". In this poem, Eliot wrote, \"The rats are underneath the piles. / The jew is underneath the lot. / Money in furs.\" Interpreting the line as an indirect comparison of Jews to rats, Julius writes: \"The anti-Semitism is unmistakable. It reaches out like a clear signal to the reader.\" Julius\\'s viewpoint has been supported by literary critics such as Harold Bloom, Christopher Ricks, George Steiner, Tom Paulin and James Fenton.In a series of lectures delivered at the University of Virginia in 1933, published under the title After Strange Gods: A Primer of Modern Heresy (1934), Eliot wrote of societal tradition and coherence, \"What is still more important [than cultural homogeneity] is unity of religious background, and reasons of race and religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable.\" Eliot never re-published this book/lecture. In his 1934 pageant play The Rock, Eliot distances himself from Fascist movements of the Thirties by caricaturing Oswald Mosley\\'s Blackshirts, who \"firmly refuse/ To descend to palaver with anthropoid Jews\". The \"new evangels\" of totalitarianism are presented as antithetic to the spirit of Christianity.\\nCraig Raine, in his books In Defence of T. S. Eliot (2001) and T. S. Eliot (2006), sought to defend Eliot from the charge of anti-Semitism. Reviewing the 2006 book, Paul Dean stated that he was not convinced by Raine\\'s argument. Nevertheless, he concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\" In another review of Raine\\'s 2006 book, the literary critic Terry Eagleton also questioned the validity of Raine\\'s defence of Eliot\\'s character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine\\'s book, writing, \"Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot\\'s well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the Archangel Gabriel does him no favours.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Influence ===\\nEliot influenced, among many others, Seán Ó Ríordáin, Máirtín Ó Díreáin, Virginia Woolf, Ezra Pound, Hart Crane, William Gaddis, Allen Tate, Ted Hughes, Geoffrey Hill, Seamus Heaney, Kamau Brathwaite, Russell Kirk, George Seferis (who in 1936 published a modern Greek translation of The Waste Land) and James Joyce.\\n\\n\\n== Honours and awards ==\\nBelow is a partial list of honours and awards received by Eliot or bestowed or created in his honour.\\n\\n\\n=== National or state honours ===\\nThese honours are displayed in order of precedence based on Eliot\\'s nationality and rules of protocol, not awarding date.\\n\\n\\n=== Literary awards ===\\nNobel Prize in Literature \"for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry\" (1948)\\nHanseatic Goethe Prize (of Hamburg) (1955)\\nDante Medal (of Florence) (1959)\\n\\n\\n=== Drama awards ===\\n1950 Tony Award for Best Play for the Broadway production of The Cocktail Party\\n1983 Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical for his poems used in the musical Cats  (posthumous award) \\n1983 Tony Award for Best Original Score for his poems used in the musical Cats (shared with Andrew Lloyd-Webber)  (posthumous award) \\n\\n\\n=== Music awards ===\\nIvor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically for his poems used in the song \"Memory\" (1982)\\n\\n\\n=== Academic awards ===\\nInducted into Phi Beta Kappa (1935)\\nThirteen Honorary Doctorates (Including ones from Oxford, Cambridge, the Sorbonne, and Harvard)\\n\\n\\n=== Other honours ===\\nEliot College of the University of Kent, England, named in his honour\\nCelebrated on U.S. commemorative postage stamps\\nStar on the St. Louis Walk of Fame\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\nSource: \"T.

       " {'Title': 'James Joyce',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (2 February 1882 – 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist, short story writer, poet, teacher, and literary critic. He contributed to the modernist avant-garde and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century. Joyce is best known for Ulysses (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer\\'s Odyssey are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, most famously stream of consciousness. Other well-known works are the short-story collection Dubliners (1914), and the novels A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Finnegans Wake (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional journalism.\\nJoyce was born in Dublin into a middle-class family. A brilliant student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run O\\'Connell School before excelling at the Jesuit schools Clongowes and Belvedere, despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father\\'s unpredictable finances. He went on to attend University College Dublin.\\nIn 1904, in his early twenties, Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) Nora Barnacle. They lived in Trieste, Paris, and Zürich. Although most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce\\'s fictional universe centres on Dublin and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of Ulysses, he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, \"For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.\"\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nOn 2 February 1882, Joyce was born at 41 Brighton Square, Rathgar, Dublin, Ireland. Joyce\\'s father was John Stanislaus Joyce and his mother was Mary Jane \"May\" Murray. He was the eldest of ten surviving siblings; two died of typhoid. James was baptised according to the Rites of the Catholic Church in the nearby St Joseph\\'s Church in Terenure on 5 February 1882 by Rev. John O\\'Mulloy. Joyce\\'s godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann.\\nJohn Stanislaus Joyce\\'s family came from Fermoy in County Cork, and had owned a small salt and lime works. Joyce\\'s paternal grandfather, James Augustine Joyce, married Ellen O\\'Connell, daughter of John O\\'Connell, a Cork Alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in Cork City. Ellen\\'s family claimed kinship with Daniel O\\'Connell, \"The Liberator\". The Joyce family\\'s purported ancestor, Seán Mór Seoighe (fl. 1680) was a stonemason from Connemara.\\n\\nIn 1887, his father was appointed rate collector by Dublin Corporation; the family subsequently moved to the fashionable adjacent small town of Bray, 12 miles (19 km) from Dublin. Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog, leading to his lifelong cynophobia. He suffered from astraphobia; a superstitious aunt had described thunderstorms as a sign of God\\'s wrath.In 1891 Joyce wrote a poem on the death of Charles Stewart Parnell. His father was angry at the treatment of Parnell by the Catholic Church, the Irish Home Rule Party and the British Liberal Party and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership. But the Vatican\\'s role in allying with the British Conservative Party to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce. The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the Vatican Library. In November, John Joyce was entered in Stubbs\\' Gazette (a publisher of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family\\'s slide into poverty caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.Joyce had begun his education at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit boarding school near Clane, County Kildare, in 1888 but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O\\'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered a place in the Jesuits\\' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest called John Conmee who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his peers at Belvedere. The philosophy of Thomas Aquinas continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\n\\nJoyce enrolled at the recently established University College Dublin (UCD) in 1898, studying English, French and Italian. He became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900 his laudatory review of Henrik Ibsen\\'s When We Dead Awaken was published in The Fortnightly Review; it was his first publication and, after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce\\'s works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, Tom Kettle, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington and Oliver St. John Gogarty. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by Arthur Griffith in his newspaper, United Irishman, in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the Irish Literary Theatre and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce. In 1901, the National Census of Ireland lists James Joyce (19) as an English- and Irish-speaking scholar living with his mother and father, six sisters and three brothers at Royal Terrace (now Inverness Road), Clontarf, Dublin.After graduating from UCD in 1902, Joyce left for Paris to study medicine, but he soon abandoned this. Richard Ellmann suggests that this may have been because he found the technical lectures in French too difficult. Joyce had already failed to pass chemistry in English in Dublin. But Joyce claimed ill health as the problem and wrote home that he was unwell and complained about the cold weather. He stayed on for a few months, appealing for finance his family could ill-afford and reading late in the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève. When his mother was diagnosed with cancer, his father sent a telegram which read, \"NOTHER  [sic] DYING COME HOME FATHER\". Joyce returned to Ireland. Fearing for her son\\'s impiety, his mother tried unsuccessfully to get Joyce to make his confession and to take communion. She finally passed into a coma and died on 13 August, James and his brother Stanislaus having refused to kneel with other members of the family praying at her bedside. After her death he continued to drink heavily, and conditions at home grew quite appalling. He scraped together a living reviewing books, teaching, and singing—he was an accomplished tenor, and won the bronze medal in the 1904 Feis Ceoil.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nOn 7 January 1904, Joyce attempted to publish A Portrait of the Artist, an essay-story dealing with aesthetics, only to have it rejected by the free-thinking magazine Dana. He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called Stephen Hero. It was a fictional rendering of Joyce\\'s youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The unfinished Stephen Hero was published after his death.Also in 1904, he met Nora Barnacle, a young woman from Galway city who was working as a chambermaid. On 16 June 1904 they had their first outing together, walking to the Dublin suburb of Ringsend, where Nora masturbated him. This event was commemorated by providing the date for the action of Ulysses (as \"Bloomsday\").Joyce remained in Dublin for some time longer, drinking heavily. After one of his drinking binges, he got into a fight over a misunderstanding with a man in St Stephen\\'s Green; he was picked up and dusted off by a minor acquaintance of his father, Alfred H. Hunter, who took him into his home to tend to his injuries. Hunter was rumoured to be a Jew and to have an unfaithful wife and would serve as one of the models for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Ulysses. He took up with the medical student Oliver St. John Gogarty, who informed the character for Buck Mulligan in Ulysses. After six nights in the Martello Tower that Gogarty was renting in Sandycove, he left in the middle of the night following an altercation which involved another student he lived with, the unstable Dermot Chenevix Trench (Haines in Ulysses), who fired a pistol at some pans hanging directly over Joyce\\'s bed. Joyce walked the 8 miles (13 km) back to Dublin to stay with relatives for the night, and sent a friend to the tower the next day to pack his trunk. Shortly after, the couple left Ireland to live on the continent.\\n\\n\\n=== 1904–20: Trieste and Zürich ===\\n\\nJoyce and Nora went into self-imposed exile, moving first to Zürich in Switzerland, where he ostensibly taught English at the Berlitz Language School through an agent in England. It later became evident that the agent had been swindled; the director of the school sent Joyce on to Trieste, which was then part of Austria-Hungary (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in Pola, then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of Croatia). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians—having discovered an espionage ring in the city—expelled all aliens. With Artifoni\\'s help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there. He remained in Trieste for most of the next ten years.Later that year Nora gave birth to their first child, George (known as Giorgio). Joyce persuaded his brother, Stanislaus, to join him in Trieste, and secured a teaching position for him at the school. Joyce sought to augment his family\\'s meagre income with his brother\\'s earnings. Stanislaus and Joyce had strained relations while they lived together in Trieste, arguing about Joyce\\'s drinking habits and frivolity with money.Joyce became frustrated with life in Trieste and moved to Rome in late 1906, taking employment as a clerk in a bank. He disliked Rome and returned to Trieste in early 1907. His daughter Lucia was born later that year.Joyce returned to Dublin in mid-1909 with George, to visit his father and work on getting Dubliners published. He visited Nora\\'s family in Galway and liked Nora\\'s mother very much. While preparing to return to Trieste he decided to take one of his sisters, Eva, back with him to help Nora run the home. He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland\\'s first cinema, the Volta Cinematograph, which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow. Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent, eventually marrying the Czech bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.Joyce returned to Dublin again briefly in mid-1912 during his years-long fight with Dublin publisher George Roberts over the publication of Dubliners. His trip was once again fruitless, and on his return he wrote the poem \"Gas from a Burner\", an invective against Roberts. After this trip, he never again came closer to Dublin than London, despite many pleas from his father and invitations from his fellow Irish writer William Butler Yeats.\\nOne of his students in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym Italo Svevo. They met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became a primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about the Jewish faith in Ulysses came from Schmitz\\'s responses to queries from Joyce. While living in Trieste, Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen surgical operations.Joyce concocted a number of money-making schemes during this period, including an attempt to become a cinema magnate in Dublin. He frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were for a long time displayed in the windows of their premises in Dublin. Joyce\\'s skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.\\nIn 1915, after most of his students in Trieste were conscripted to fight in the Great War, Joyce moved to Zürich. Two influential private students, Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco Sordina, petitioned officials for an exit permit for the Joyces, who in turn agreed not to take any action against the emperor of Austria-Hungary during the war.During this period Joyce took an active interest in socialism. He had attended socialist meetings when he was still in Dublin and 1905, while in Trieste, he described his politics as \"those of a socialist artist.\" Although his practical engagement waned after 1907 due to the \"endless internecine warfare\" he observed in socialist organizations, many Joyce scholars such as Richard Ellmann, Dominic Manganiello, Robert Scholes, and George J. Watson agree that Joyce\\'s interest in socialism and pacifistic anarchism continued for much of his life, and that both the form and content of Joyce\\'s work reflect a sympathy for democratic and socialist ideas. In 1918 he declared himself \"against every state\" and found much succor in the individualist philosophies of Benjamin Tucker and Oscar Wilde\\'s The Soul of Man Under Socialism.\\n\\n\\n=== 1920–41: Paris and Zürich ===\\n\\nJoyce set himself to finishing Ulysses in Paris, delighted to find that he was gradually gaining fame as an avant-garde writer. A further grant from Harriet Shaw Weaver meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city. During this time, Joyce\\'s eyes began to give him more and more problems and he often wore an eyepatch. He was treated by Louis Borsch in Paris, undergoing nine operations before Borsch\\'s death in 1929. Throughout the 1930s he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and for treatments for his daughter Lucia, who, according to the Joyces, suffered from schizophrenia. Lucia was analysed by Carl Jung at the time, who after reading Ulysses is said to have concluded that her father had schizophrenia. Jung said that she and her father were two people heading to the bottom of a river, except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was sinking.In Paris, Maria and Eugene Jolas nursed Joyce during his long years of writing Finnegans Wake. Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver\\'s constant financial support), there is a good possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine transition, the Jolases published serially various sections of Finnegans Wake under the title Work in Progress. Joyce returned to Zürich in late 1940, fleeing the Nazi occupation of France. Joyce used his contacts to help some sixteen Jews escape Nazi persecution.\\n\\n\\n=== Joyce and religion ===\\nThe issue of Joyce\\'s relationship with religion is somewhat controversial. Early in life, he lapsed from Catholicism, according to first-hand testimonies coming from himself, his brother Stanislaus Joyce, and his wife:\\n\\nMy mind rejects the whole present social order and Christianity—home, the recognised virtues, classes of life and religious doctrines. ... Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it impossible for me to remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.\\nWhen the arrangements for Joyce\\'s burial were being made, a Catholic priest offered a religious service, which Joyce\\'s wife, Nora, declined, saying, \"I couldn\\'t do that to him.\"Leonard Strong, William T. Noon, Robert Boyle and others have argued that Joyce, later in life, reconciled with the faith he rejected earlier in life and that his parting with the faith was succeeded by a not so obvious reunion, and that Ulysses and Finnegans Wake are essentially Catholic expressions. Likewise, Hugh Kenner and T.S. Eliot believed they saw between the lines of Joyce\\'s work the outlook of a serious Christian and that beneath the veneer of the work lies a remnant of Catholic belief and attitude. Kevin Sullivan maintains that, rather than reconciling with the faith, Joyce never left it. Critics holding this view insist that Stephen, the protagonist of the semi-autobiographical A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as well as Ulysses, is not Joyce. Somewhat cryptically, in an interview after completing Ulysses, in response to the question \"When did you leave the Catholic Church\", Joyce answered, \"That\\'s for the Church to say.\" Eamonn Hughes maintains that Joyce takes a dialectic approach, both affirming and denying, saying that Stephen\\'s much noted non-serviam is qualified—\"I will not serve that which I no longer believe...\", and that the non-serviam will always be balanced by Stephen\\'s \"I am a servant...\" and Molly\\'s \"yes\". He attended Catholic Mass and Orthodox Divine Liturgy, especially during Holy Week, purportedly for aesthetic reasons. His sisters noted his Holy Week attendance and that he did not seek to dissuade them. One friend witnessed him cry \"secret tears\" upon hearing Jesus\\' words on the cross and another accused him of being a \"believer at heart\" because of his frequent attendance at church.Umberto Eco compares Joyce to the ancient episcopi vagantes (wandering bishops) in the Middle Ages. They left a discipline, not a cultural heritage or a way of thinking. Like them, the writer retains the sense of blasphemy held as a liturgical ritual.Some critics and biographers have opined along the lines of Andrew Gibson: \"The modern James Joyce may have vigorously resisted the oppressive power of Catholic tradition. But there was another Joyce who asserted his allegiance to that tradition, and never left it, or wanted to leave it, behind him.\" Gibson argues that Joyce \"remained a Catholic intellectual if not a believer\" since his thinking remained influenced by his cultural background, even though he lived apart from that culture. His relationship with religion was complex and not easily understood, even perhaps by himself. He acknowledged the debt he owed to his early Jesuit training. Joyce told the sculptor August Suter, that from his Jesuit education, he had \\'learnt to arrange things in such a way that they become easy to survey and to judge.\\'\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\n\\nOn 11 January 1941, Joyce underwent surgery in Zürich for a perforated duodenal ulcer. He fell into a coma the following day. He awoke at 2 a.m. on 13 January 1941, and asked a nurse to call his wife and son, before losing consciousness again. They were en route when he died 15 minutes later. Joyce was less than a month short of his 59th birthday.His body was buried in the Fluntern Cemetery, Zürich. The Swiss tenor Max Meili sang Addio terra, addio cielo from Monteverdi\\'s L\\'Orfeo at the burial service. Although two senior Irish diplomats were in Switzerland at the time, neither attended Joyce\\'s funeral, and the Irish government later declined Nora\\'s offer to permit the repatriation of Joyce\\'s remains. When Joseph Walshe, secretary at the Department of External Affairs in Dublin, was informed of Joyce\\'s death by Frank Cremins, chargé d\\'affaires at Bern, Walshe responded \"Please wire details of Joyce\\'s death. If possible find out did he die a Catholic? Express sympathy with Mrs Joyce and explain inability to attend funeral\". Buried originally in an ordinary grave, Joyce was moved in 1966 to a more prominent \"honour grave,\" with a seated portrait statue by American artist Milton Hebald nearby. Nora, whom he had married in 1931, survived him by 10 years. She is buried by his side, as is their son Giorgio, who died in 1976.In October 2019 a motion was put to Dublin City Council to plan and budget for the costs of the exhumations and reburials of Joyce and his family somewhere in Dublin, subject to his family\\'s wishes. The proposal immediately became controversial, with the Irish Times commenting: \\'.. it is hard not to suspect that there is a calculating, even mercantile, aspect to contemporary Ireland’s relationship to its great writers, whom we are often more keen to “celebrate”, and if possible monetise, than read\\'.\\n\\n\\n== Major works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Dubliners ===\\n\\nDubliners is a collection of fifteen short stories by Joyce, first published in 1914. They form a naturalistic depiction of Irish middle-class life in and around Dublin in the early years of the 20th century.\\nThe stories were written when Irish nationalism was at its peak and a search for a national identity and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by converging ideas and influences. The stories centre on Joyce\\'s idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce\\'s novel Ulysses. The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce\\'s tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.\\n\\n\\n=== A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man ===\\n\\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a nearly complete rewrite of the abandoned novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript in a fit of rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character\\'s psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.\\n\\n\\n=== Exiles and poetry ===\\n\\nDespite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, Exiles, begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband-and-wife relationship, the play looks back to The Dead (the final story in Dubliners) and forward to Ulysses, which Joyce began around the time of the play\\'s composition.\\nJoyce published a number of books of poetry. His first mature published work was the satirical broadside \"The Holy Office\" (1904), in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the Celtic Revival. His first full-length poetry collection, Chamber Music (1907; referring, Joyce joked, to the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot), consisted of 36 short lyrics. This publication led to his inclusion in the Imagist Anthology, edited by Ezra Pound, who was a champion of Joyce\\'s work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime include \"Gas from a Burner\" (1912), Pomes Penyeach (1927) and \"Ecce Puer\" (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). It was published by the Black Sun Press in Collected Poems (1936).\\n\\n\\n=== Ulysses ===\\n\\nAs he was completing work on Dubliners in 1906, Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called Leopold Bloom under the title Ulysses. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).\\nThanks to Ezra Pound, serial publication of the novel in the magazine The Little Review began in March 1918. This magazine was edited by Margaret C. Anderson and Jane Heap, with the intermittent financial backing of John Quinn, a successful New York commercial lawyer with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature.\\nThis provoked the first accusations of obscenity with which the book would be identified for so long. Its amorphous structure with frank, intimate musings (‘stream of consciousness’) were seen to offend both church and state. The publication encountered problems with New York Postal Authorities; serialisation ground to a halt in December 1920; the editors were convicted of publishing obscenity in February 1921. Although the conviction was based on the \"Nausicaä\" episode of Ulysses, The Little Review had fuelled the fires of controversy with dada poet Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven\\'s defence of Ulysses in an essay \"The Modest Woman.\" Joyce\\'s novel was not published in the United States until 1934.Partly because of this controversy, Joyce found it difficult to get a publisher to accept the book, but it was published in 1922 by Sylvia Beach from her well-known Rive Gauche bookshop, Shakespeare and Company. An English edition published the same year by Joyce\\'s patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, John Rodker produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at Folkestone. A further consequence of the novel\\'s ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of \"bootleg\" versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher Samuel Roth. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.\\nWith the appearance of both Ulysses and T.S. Eliot\\'s poem, The Waste Land, 1922 was a key year in the history of English-language literary modernism. In Ulysses, Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters. The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the Odyssey of Homer in modern Dublin and represents Odysseus (Ulysses), Penelope and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly Bloom and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of Thom\\'s Directory—a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.\\nThe book consists of 18 chapters, each covering roughly one hour of the day, beginning around about 8 a.m. and ending sometime after 2 a.m. the following morning. Each of the 18 chapters of the novel employs its own literary style. Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer\\'s Odyssey and has a specific colour, art or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure represents one of the book\\'s major contributions to the development of 20th century modernist literature. Other contributions include the use of classical mythology as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, \"I may have oversystematised Ulysses,\" and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer. Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form. It was only when Stuart Gilbert published his critical work on Ulysses in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert. But as Terrence Killeen points out this schema was developed after the novel had been written and was not something that Joyce consulted as he wrote the novel.\\n\\n\\n=== Finnegans Wake ===\\n\\nHaving completed work on Ulysses, Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for a year. On 10 March 1923 he informed his patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver: \"Yesterday I wrote two pages—the first I have since the final Yes of Ulysses. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of foolscap so that I could read them. Il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio, the Italians say. \\'The wolf may lose his skin but not his vice\\' or \\'the leopard cannot change his spots.\\'\" Thus was born a text that became known, first, as Work in Progress and later Finnegans Wake.\\nBy 1926 Joyce had completed the first two parts of the book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including the death of his father in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce\\'s fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce\\'s superstitions.Reaction to the work was mixed, including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce\\'s work, such as Pound and the author\\'s brother, Stanislaus Joyce. To counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, William Carlos Williams and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress. At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases\\' home, Joyce revealed the final title of the work and Finnegans Wake was published in book form on 4 May 1939. Later, further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author Hervey Cleckley, who questioned the significance others had placed on the work. In his book The Mask of Sanity, Cleckley refers to Finnegans Wake as \"a 628-page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar word salad produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital.\"Joyce\\'s method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in Finnegans Wake, which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than, that used by Lewis Carroll in Jabberwocky. This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce\\'s oft-quoted description in the Wake of Ulysses as his \"usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles\" to the Wake itself. However, readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot.\\nMuch of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce\\'s eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author\\'s dictation.The view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by Giambattista Vico, and the metaphysics of Giordano Bruno of Nola are important to the interplay of the \"characters\". Vico propounded a cyclical view of history, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico\\'s cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book. Finnegans Wake opens with the words \"riverrun, past Eve and Adam\\'s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs\" (\"vicus\" is a pun on Vico) and ends \"A way a lone a last a loved a long the\". In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle. Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the Wake would suffer from \"ideal insomnia\" and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\nJoyce\\'s work has been an important influence on writers and scholars such as Samuel Beckett, Seán Ó Ríordáin, Jorge Luis Borges, Flann O\\'Brien, Salman Rushdie, Robert Anton Wilson, John Updike, David Lodge, Cormac McCarthy, and Joseph Campbell. Ulysses has been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire [Modernist] movement\". The Bulgarian-French literary theorist Julia Kristeva characterised Joyce\\'s novel writing as \"polyphonic\" and a hallmark of postmodernity alongside the poets Mallarmé and Rimbaud.\\n\\nSome scholars, notably Vladimir Nabokov, have reservations, often championing some of his fiction while condemning other works. In Nabokov\\'s opinion, Ulysses was brilliant, while Finnegans Wake was horrible.Joyce\\'s influence is also evident in fields other than literature. The sentence \"Three quarks for Muster Mark!\" in Joyce\\'s Finnegans Wake is the source of the word \"quark\", the name of one of the elementary particles proposed by the physicist Murray Gell-Mann in 1963.The work and life of Joyce is celebrated annually on 16 June, known as Bloomsday, in Dublin and in an increasing number of cities worldwide, and critical studies in scholarly publications, such as the James Joyce Quarterly, continue. Both popular and academic uses of Joyce\\'s work were hampered by restrictions imposed by Stephen J. Joyce, Joyce\\'s grandson and executor of his literary estate. On 1 January 2012, those restrictions were lessened by the expiry of copyright protection of much of the published work of James Joyce.In April 2013 the Central Bank of Ireland issued a silver €10 commemorative coin in honour of Joyce that misquoted a famous line from Ulysses.\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Prose ===\\nDubliners (short-story collection, 1914)\\nA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (novel, 1916)\\nUlysses (novel, 1922)\\nFinnegans Wake (1939, restored 2012)\\n\\n\\n=== Poetry collections ===\\nChamber Music (poems, Elkin Mathews, 1907)\\nGiacomo Joyce (written 1907, published by Faber and Faber, 1968)\\nPomes Penyeach (poems, Shakespeare and Company, 1927)\\nCollected Poems (poems, Black Sun Press, 1936, which includes Chamber Music, Pomes Penyeach and other previously published works)\\n\\n\\n=== Play ===\\nExiles (play, 1918)\\n\\n\\n=== Posthumous publications and drafts ===\\nFiction\\n\\nStephen Hero (precursor to A Portrait; written 1904–06, published 1944)\\nThe Cat and the Devil (London: Faber and Faber, 1965)\\nThe Cats of Copenhagen (Ithys Press, 2012)\\nFinn\\'s Hotel (Ithys Press, 2013)Non-Fiction\\n\\nThe Critical Writings of James Joyce (Eds.

       " {'Title': 'Claude McKay',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'Festus Claudius \"Claude\" McKay (September 15, 1889 – May 22, 1948) was a Jamaican writer and poet, who was a seminal figure in the Harlem Renaissance. He wrote five novels: Home to Harlem (1928), a best-seller that won the Harmon Gold Award for Literature, Banjo (1929), Banana Bottom (1933), Romance in Marseille (published in 2020), and in 1941 a manuscript called Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem which remained unpublished until 2017. McKay also authored collections of poetry, a collection of short stories, Gingertown (1932), two autobiographical books, A Long Way from Home (1937) and My Green Hills of Jamaica (published posthumously in 1979), and a non-fiction, socio-historical treatise entitled Harlem: Negro Metropolis (1940). His 1922 poetry collection, Harlem Shadows, was among the first books published during the Harlem Renaissance. His Selected Poems was published posthumously, in 1953.\\nMcKay was attracted to communism in his early life, but he always asserted that he never became an official member of the Communist Party USA. However, some scholars dispute that claim, noting his close ties to active members, his attendance at communist-led events, and his months-long stay in the Soviet Union in 1922–23, which he wrote about very favorably. He gradually became disillusioned with communism, however, and by the mid-1930s had begun to write negatively about it. By the late 1930s his anti-Stalinism isolated him from other Harlem intellectuals, and by 1942 he converted to Catholicism and left Harlem, and he worked for a Catholic organization until his death.\\n\\n\\n== Early life in Jamaica ==\\nFestus Claudius McKay, known as Claude McKay, was born September 15, 1889 or 1890 in Nairne Castle near James Hill in upper Clarendon Parish, Jamaica. He referred to his home village as Sunny Ville, a name given to the area by locals. He was the youngest child of Thomas Francis McKay and Hannah Ann Elizabeth Edwards, well-to-do farmers who had enough property to qualify to vote. He had seven siblings. McKay\\'s parents were active and well-respected members of the Baptist faith. Thomas was a strict, religious man who struggled to develop close relationships with his children due to his serious nature. In contrast, Hannah had a warmth that allowed her to give love freely to all of her children. Thomas was of Ashanti descent, while Hannah traced her ancestry to Madagascar. Claude recounted that his father would often share stories of Ashanti customs with the family.At the age of four, McKay went to school at Mt. Zion Church. Around the age of nine, he was sent to live with his oldest brother, Uriah Theodore, also known as U\\'Theo, a teacher, to be given a proper education. His brother also enjoyed being a journalist, even though he did not professionally do this for a living. Due to his brother\\'s influence, McKay became an avid reader of classical and British literature, as well as philosophy, science and theology. With the time he had on his hands, he would read poems during that time and other material; a lot of material he read was William Shakespeare\\'s work. When McKay was in elementary school, he became very intrigued and passionate about poetry, which he started to write at the age of 10.As a teenager in 1906, he became apprenticed to a carriage and cabinet maker known as Old Brenga, maintaining his apprenticeship for about two years. During that time, in 1907, McKay met a man named Walter Jekyll, who became a mentor and an inspiration for him, who also encouraged him to concentrate on his writing. Jekyll convinced McKay to write in his native dialect, and then set some of McKay\\'s verses to music. Jekyll helped McKay publish his first book of poems, Songs of Jamaica, in 1912. These were the first poems published in Jamaican Patois (dialect of mainly English words and African structure). McKay\\'s next volume, Constab Ballads (1912), was based on his experiences of joining the constabulary for a brief period in 1911.McKay\\'s poem \"The Tropics in New York\" highlights his memory of the Caribbean. The poem takes place in New York, where he worked as a labor worker. The fruits in New York causes the speaker of the poem to feel nostalgic. The poem describes the many Caribbean fruits integrated into the New York \"cityscape,\" such as,\"alligator pears, mangoes, and tangerines\". The color of the fruits remind him of the colors and the diversity in Jamaica. He incorporates figurative language in order to; explain his longing for old ways. For example, the speaker describes how he is \"hungry for old familiar ways/ a wave of longing through my body wept\". He reminiscences on his life back home in Jamaica, which explains why he identifies with the many fruits sold on the New York city streets.\\n\\n\\n== First stay in the U. S. A. ==\\nMcKay left for the U.S. in 1912 to attend Tuskegee Institute.  He was shocked by the intense racism he encountered when he arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, where many public facilities were segregated; this inspired him to write more poetry. At Tuskegee, he disliked the \"semi-military, machine-like existence there\" and quickly left to study at Kansas State University. At Kansas State, he read W. E. B. Du Bois\\' Souls of Black Folk, which had a major impact on him and stirred his political involvement. But despite superior academic performance, in 1914 he decided he did not want to be an agronomist and moved to New York City, where he married his childhood sweetheart Eulalie Lewars.\\n\\nMcKay published two poems in 1917 in The Seven Arts under the pseudonym Eli Edwards while working as a waiter on the railways. In 1919, he met Crystal and Max Eastman, who produced The Liberator (where McKay would serve as co-executive editor until 1922). It was here, as the co-editor of The Liberator, that he published one of his most famous poems, \"If We Must Die\", during the \"Red Summer\", a period of intense racial violence against black people in Anglo-American societies. The poem was reportedly later quoted by Winston Churchill during World War II.In this period McKay joined the Industrial Workers of the World. He also became involved with a group of black radicals who were unhappy both with Marcus Garvey\\'s nationalism and the middle-class reformist NAACP. These included other Caribbean writers such as Cyril Briggs, Richard B. Moore, and Wilfred Domingo. They fought for black self-determination within the context of socialist revolution. Together they founded the semi-secret revolutionary organization, the African Blood Brotherhood. Hubert Harrison had asked McKay to write for Garvey\\'s Negro World, but only a few copies of the paper have survived from this period, none of which contain any articles by McKay. McKay soon left for London, England.\\n\\n\\n== Sojourn in the United Kingdom ==\\nIn 1919, McKay arrived in London, where he would frequent two clubs, a soldiers\\' club in Drury Lane, and the International Socialist Club in Shoreditch. A militant atheist, he also joined the Rationalist Press Association. It was during this period that his commitment to socialism deepened and he read Marx assiduously. At the International Socialist Club, McKay met Shapurji Saklatvala, A. J. Cook, Guy Aldred, Jack Tanner, Arthur McManus, William Gallacher, Sylvia Pankhurst and George Lansbury. McKay was soon invited to write for Workers\\' Dreadnought.\\nIn April 1920, the Daily Herald, a socialist paper published by George Lansbury, included a racist article written by E. D. Morel. Entitled \"Black Scourge in Europe: Sexual Horror Let Loose by France on the Rhine\", it insinuated gross hypersexuality on black people in general. Lansbury refused to print McKay\\'s response. This response then appeared in Workers\\' Dreadnought. In response to the \"Black Horror on the Rhine\" stories that the Daily Herald was running, McKay wrote:\\n\\nWhy this obscene maniacal outburst about the sex vitality of black men in a proletarian paper?\" Rape is rape; the colour of the skin doesn\\'t make it different. Negroes are no more over-sexed than Caucasians; mulatto children in the West Indies and America were not the result of parthenogenesis. If Negro troops had syphilis, they contracted it from the white and yellow races. As for German women, in their economic plight they were selling themselves to anyone. I do not protest because I happen to be a Negro ... I write because I feel that the ultimate result of your propaganda will be further strife and blood-spilling between whites and the many members of my race ... who have been dumped down on the English docks since the ending of the European war ... Bourbons of the United States will thank you, and the proletarian underworld of London will certainly gloat over the scoop of the Christian-Socialist pacifist Daily Herald.\\nSince January 1920, McKay had been involved with the Workers\\' Dreadnought and the Workers\\' Socialist Federation, a Council Communist group active in the East End and which had a majority of women involved in it at all levels of the organization. He became a paid journalist for the paper; some people claim he was the first black journalist in Britain. He attended the Communist Unity Conference that established the Communist Party of Great Britain. At this time he also had some of his poetry published in the Cambridge Magazine, edited by C. K. Ogden.\\nWhen Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act for publishing articles \"calculated and likely to cause sedition among His Majesty\\'s forces, in the Navy, and among the civilian population,\" McKay had his rooms searched. He is likely to have been the author of \"The Yellow Peril and the Dockers\" attributed to \"Leon Lopez\", which was one of the articles cited by the government in its case against Workers\\' Dreadnought.\\n\\n\\n== Return to the United States ==\\n\\n\\n== Trip to Russia ==\\n\\nWhen Russia was under the rule of Communist Party led by Lenin he was invited to Russia during the reconstruction of the country. In November 1922, in what he referred to as his \"Magic Pilgrimage,\" he traveled to Russia with Max Eastman to take part in the Fourth Congress of the Communist International in Petrograd and Moscow. McKay financed his trip to Russia by repackaging and selling Harlem Shadows, \"complete with a signed photograph and an inflated price tag\" to members of an NAACP donor list. He was greeted in Russia with an \"ecstatic welcome\" and \"rock-star treatment.\"A couple years later, McKay visited Russia again and when he arrived there was greeted with enthusiasm and friendliness.  He was so well known in Russia that the brother of Nicholas the Second let him stay at his palace.  People from all walks of life in Russia knew or heard of him and all had a desire or interest to learn what life was like for a Negro person in the United States.  For example, soldiers in the Soviet army wanted to know what life was like for a Negro soldier in the United States military system and the Russian women were also interested of how well  a Negro woman and white woman worked together.  However, McKay also noticed life in Russia was very similar to the life of a Negro man in the United States.  He noticed that people who were of a certain faith or religion were not given the same rights or opportunities as other people were able to receive. For example, people who practiced Judaism, were not allowed to apply for higher positions or jobs in the Soviet army. McKay also noticed that Russians had little understanding of why Negroes were treated so horribly in the United States and tried to enlighten them.\\n\\n\\n== Visit to Morocco ==\\nMcKay wrote about his travels in Morocco in his 1937 autobiography A Long Way from Home. Before this journey he went to Paris, where he contracted a severe respiratory infection and required hospitalization. After recovering he continued traveling, and for 11 years ventured around Europe and parts of Northern Africa. During this stint he published three novels, and the most notable title from this period was Home to Harlem. This novel was published in 1928 where it was viewed various different ways. In The Negro Novel in America Robert Bone thought that it represented \"different ways of rebelling against Western civilization\", adding that McKay was not entirely successful in articulating his protagonists. However, other people thought that the novel provided a detailed portrayal of the underside of black urban life with its prostitutes and gamblers.\\nBanana Bottom was another work he created during this 11-year span. Here McKay presented a clear depiction of his principal theme, that black individuals quest for cultural identity in a white society. Critics of the book all agreed that Banana Bottom is McKay\\'s most skillful delineation of black individuals\\' predicament in white society. His final year abroad brought the creation of Gingertown, a collection of 12 short stories. Half of these tales depict his life in Harlem and the others revolve around his time in Jamaica.\\n\\n\\n== Literary movements and traditions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Participation in Harlem Renaissance ===\\nMcKay flourished as a poet during the Harlem Renaissance, a major literary movement in the 1920s. During this time, his poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations of life as a black man in both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism and felt that racist people were stupid and could not look past their shortsightedness and hatred. In tales such as Home to Harlem, he depicts a culture in Harlem that is full of drug use, prostitution, and a variety of sexual encounters. His depiction was criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W. E. B. DuBois, but was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance. McKay\\'s poetry brought awareness to the racist treatment that many black individuals faced.\\nOne of his works that challenges racial discrimination in the Harlem Renaissance is his poem If We Must Die. It looks to defend black rights and threatens for prejudice and abuse. He wanted his people to fight with determination and courage to those who would murder them. It calls to any race or anyone being discriminated against to fight for their freedom and what is right. What influenced him to write this poem was the clash between white and African Americans. McKay was afraid of the dangers that were happening all over the United States. The hangings, the shootings, the murders. Working as a porter on the railways, he would go from town to town not knowing what to expect. Some nights he would stay indoors because of the fear of danger going on outside. The creation of this poem had pushed him to become one of the most influential spokesman that promoted radicalism in America.\\nMcKay divested himself from many aspects and growing prescriptions of modernism.  By the beginning of the 20th century, the sonnet form had become an antiquated poetic style, but McKay found it an ideal a medium to convey his ideas. Many modernists, however, rejected and criticized his use of the sonnet. Despite their reaction, he persevered and created a significant number of modern sonnets.\\nHaving spent time among the artists of Paris in the 1920s, he was intimately acquainted with the dynamics between painters and models and the manner in which modernist painters presented African subjects and African culture. In her article \"Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys\" Leah Rosenberg writes: \"The fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism\". The inclination to stereotype and caricature the African physical form created, however inadvertently, a form of hegemony reminiscent to McKay of the colonialism he grew up with in Jamaica. \"Sexuality and black culture,\" Rosenberg explains, \"held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein\". In need of money, McKay posed nude for the Cubist painter André Lhote. Through his experience, McKay saw first-hand how the larger social hegemony between European white supremacy and people of Afro-Caribbean descent could play itself out between the artist and its subject. McKay critically recalled the experience in various ways in many of his most notable works. In doing so, he shone a critical light on a cornerstone of modernism and once again pushed back against a system in which he found himself.\\n\\n\\n== Political views and social activism ==\\nMcKay joined the Industrial Workers of the World in autumn 1919, while working in a factory following his time as a dining-car waiter on the railways.\\nAccording to his autobiographies A Long Way From Home and My Green Hills of Jamaica, he claimed he was drawn to the Communist party because it offered independence. McKay believed that the Communists in the US had other things on their agenda, and the African Americans were not part of that at all. Furthermore, he thought that they were using the Negro race to fight their battles. Because of his views on communism in America, he sought out help from Russia. McKay had seen and heard of the Russians\\' acceptance toward other communists and individuals, for their goal was to unite non-Europeans and normalize homosexual relationships, and felt a kinship to the movement. He addressed the Communists in Russia with his speech \"Report on the Negro Question\" and argued that America was not fully accepting of the Negro Communists.After his speech, he was asked by the Communist Party in Russia to explore this idea more in the form of a book. He wrote Negry v Amerike in 1923. He wrote this in Russian, and it was not translated into English until 1979. Later in life, he came to the conclusion that the Communist Party suppressed the idea of individuality and independent thought. Before coming back to America, he denounced the Communist thoughts, as documented in his autobiography A Long Way From Home. and looked for other areas to meet his needs.\\nPast McKay\\'s Communist ideologies, he engaged in activism through his literature that reached many countries and territories globally, with the city of Harlem, within the US, being especially effected by it. As a specific example, McKay urged the acceptance of strong African-American individuals as well as romantic relationships between homosexual couples within his novel Home to Harlem, which is the first in a series that follows the lives and experiences of black men with stable incomes and the courage to stand up for themselves and their beliefs. Through the eyes of one of the main characters those who read Home to Harlem can feel how much animosity McKay feels toward Harlem as the epicenter for African Americans. It is obvious that McKay sees Harlem as too complacent and submissive to the hetero-normative lifestyle and he wished for it to be a place all African American people, no matter the orientation, could live comfortably and happily. When broken down though, McKay worked toward equality and the welcoming of diversity within a population. With the concept of the new negro taking hold within America and beyond in the twenties, McKay wrote poems and prose to strengthen the movement and urge others to regard their race and sexuality as valid.\\n\\n\\n== Sexuality ==\\nIt is widely assumed that McKay was bisexual, as he pursued relationships with both men and women throughout his life. He particularly enjoyed the simultaneous secrecy of New York City; he never officially \"came out\" nor explicitly stated his sexual preference, but he was able to enter the \"clandestine\" homosexual communities of New York and find acceptance within them. Despite never having confirmed his sexuality, homosexual sentiments are clear in several of his poems. In others, the gender of the speaker is not identified, which leaves to interpretation the nature of the relationships presented in said works.Some key evidence that could support the idea of Mckay being bisexual could be his relationship with Walter Jekyll. Some say that it may have been a homosexual relationship between a younger man seduced by an older man. According to Josephine Herbst, she claims that he was bisexual and that she could personally attest that she received syphilis from him during their relationship. However, in his works, nothing provides support for this idea. During his life, McKay was attracted to several men, including Max Eastman from The Liberator, Frank Harris, who was an editor for Pearson\\'s Magazine, and Bishop Henry Sheil who worked for the Catholic Church. Walter Jekyll\\'s influence on Mckay resulted in a combination of social implications. In the 1910s and 1920s he maintained an on-off relationship with the English labor advocate, poet, and translator Charles Ashleigh.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\nIn 1928, McKay published his most famous novel, Home to Harlem, which won the Harmon Gold Award for Literature. The novel, which depicted street life in Harlem, would have a major impact on black intellectuals in the Caribbean, West Africa, and Europe.Home to Harlem gained a substantial readership, especially among people who wanted to know more about the intense, and sometimes shocking, details of Harlem nightlife. His novel was an attempt to capture the energetic and intense spirit of the \"uprooted black vagabonds.\" In Home to Harlem McKay looked among the common people for a distinctive black identity.Despite this, the book drew fire from one of McKay\\'s contemporaries, W. E. B. Du Bois. To Du Bois, the novel\\'s frank depictions of sexuality and the nightlife in Harlem only appealed to the \"prurient demand[s]\" of white readers and publishers looking for portrayals of black \"licentiousness.\" As Du Bois said, \"Home to Harlem ... for the most part nauseates me, and after the dirtier parts of its filth I feel distinctly like taking a bath.\" Modern critics now dismiss this criticism from Du Bois, who was more concerned with using art as propaganda in the struggle for African-American political liberation than in the value of art to showcase the truth about the lives of black people.McKay\\'s other novels were Banjo (1929) and Banana Bottom (1933). Banjo was noted in part for its portrayal of how the French treated people from its sub-Saharan African colonies, as the novel centers on black seamen in Marseilles. Aimé Césaire stated that in Banjo, blacks were described truthfully and without \"inhibition or prejudice\". Banana Bottom, McKay\\'s third novel, is said to follow a principal theme of a black individual in search of establishing a cultural identity in a white society. The book discusses underlying racial and cultural tensions.McKay also authored a collection of short stories, Gingertown (1932), two autobiographical books, A Long Way from Home (1937) and My Green Hills of Jamaica (published posthumously in 1979), and a non-fiction, socio-historical treatise entitled Harlem: Negro Metropolis (1940). His collection Selected Poems (1953) was published posthumously and included a Foreword by John Dewey.McKay became an American citizen in 1940.In 1943, one year before his conversion into Catholicism, McKay started \"Cycle Manuscript\", a collection of 44 poems, mostly sonnets.  In addition, he wrote a letter to Max Eastman, editor of the socialist journal The Liberator, Harlem Renaissance leader, and McKay\\'s close friend, asking Eastman \"to look through\" all the poems and to make any needed \"revisions\".  Despite Eastman\\'s revisions, McKay\\'s collection would never be published. The \"Cycle Manuscript\" remains to be a typescript at the Beinecke Library at Yale University, as the \"Cycle Manuscript\" is an important document that illustrates the reflections of an emotional poet who was seeking self-actualization at his point of his life.Becoming disillusioned with communism, McKay embraced the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, to which he converted in 1944. He died from a heart attack in Chicago at the age of 58 and is buried at Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York).\\n\\n\\n== Religion ==\\nToward the end of his life, McKay embraced Catholicism, retreating from Communism entirely.  His sudden conversion to Catholicism puzzled many for over half a century. When he converted to Catholicism in his final years, he was perceived to be suffering from poverty, health problems, and political and social exclusion by his own beloved Harlem.  Before his actual conversion, he wrote to long-time friend and mentor, Max Eastman, about \"doing a lot of reading and research, especially on Catholic work among Negroes----Because if and when I take the step I want to be intellectually honest and sincere about it\". (McKay to Eastman, June 1, 1944). Five months later, when McKay was baptized into the Holy Roman Catholic Church, he wrote to Eastman to assure him that \"I am not less the fighter\" for doing so (McKay to Eastman, October 16, 1944, Rpt. in Passion 305).\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nIn 1977, the government of Jamaica named Claude McKay the national poet and posthumously awarded him the Order of Jamaica for his contribution to literature.In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Claude McKay on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. McKay is regarded as the \"foremost left-wing black intellectual of his age\" and his work heavily influenced a generation of black authors including James Baldwin and Richard Wright.Claude McKay\\'s poem \"If We Must Die\" was recited in the film August 28: A Day in the Life of a People, which debuted at the opening of the Smithsonian\\'s National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2016.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nJamaican Institute of Arts and Sciences, Musgrave Medal, 1912, for two volumes of poetry, Songs of Jamaica and Constab Ballads.\\nHarmon Foundation Award for distinguished literary achievement, NAACP, 1929, for Harlem Shadows and Home to Harlem.\\nJames Weldon Johnson Literary Guild Award, 1937.\\nOrder of Jamaica, 1977.\\n\\n\\n== Selected works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Poetry collections ===\\nSongs of Jamaica (1912)\\nConstab Ballads (1912)\\nSpring in New Hampshire and Other Poems (1920)\\nHarlem Shadows (1922)\\nThe Selected Poems of Claude McKay (1953)\\nComplete Poems (2004)\\n\\n\\n=== Fiction ===\\nHome to Harlem (1928)\\nBanjo (1929)\\nBanana Bottom (1933)\\nGingertown (1932)\\nHarlem Glory (1990) - but written 1940\\nAmiable with Big Teeth (2017) - but composed in 1941\\nRomance in Marseille (2020) - but written between 1929-1933\\n\\n\\n=== Non-fiction ===\\nA Long Way from Home (1937)\\nMy Green Hills of Jamaica (1979)\\nHarlem: Negro Metropolis (1940)\\n\\n\\n=== Unknown manuscript ===\\nA previously unknown manuscript of a 1941 novel by McKay was authenticated in 2012.

The novel centers on the ideas and events that animated Harlem on the cusp of World War II (such as Benito Mussolini\\'s invasion of Ethiopia). Working in collaboration, Professor Cloutier (now at the University of Pennsylvania) and his advisor Professor Brent Hayes Edwards successfully authenticated the manuscript, and have received permission from the McKay estate to publish the novel, a satire set in 1936, with an introduction about how it was found and its provenance verified.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\nCooper, Wayne F.

       " {'Title': 'Seamus Heaney',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'Seamus Justin Heaney  (; 13 April 1939 – 30 August 2013) was an Irish poet, playwright and translator. He received the 1995 Nobel Prize in Literature. Among his best-known works is Death of a Naturalist (1966), his first major published volume. Heaney was recognised as one of the principal contributors to poetry during his lifetime.  American poet Robert Lowell described him as \"the most important Irish poet since Yeats\", and many others, including the academic John Sutherland, have said that he was \"the greatest poet of our age\". Robert Pinsky has stated that \"with his wonderful gift of eye and ear Heaney has the gift of the story-teller.\" Upon his death in 2013, The Independent described him as \"probably the best-known poet in the world\".He was born in the townland of Tamniaran between Castledawson and Toomebridge, Northern Ireland. His family moved to nearby Bellaghy when he was a boy. He became a lecturer at St. Joseph\\'s College in Belfast in the early 1960s, after attending Queen\\'s University and began to publish poetry. He lived in Sandymount, Dublin, from 1976 until his death. He  lived part-time in the United States from 1981 to 2006.\\nHeaney was a professor at Harvard from 1981 to 1997, and its Poet in Residence from 1988 to 2006. From 1989 to 1994, he was also the Professor of Poetry at Oxford. In 1996, was made a Commandeur de l\\'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and in 1998 was bestowed the title Saoi of the Aosdána. Other awards that he received include the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize (1968), the E. M. Forster Award (1975), the PEN Translation Prize (1985), the Golden Wreath of Poetry (2001), the T. S. Eliot Prize (2006) and two Whitbread Prizes (1996 and 1999). In 2011, he was awarded the Griffin Poetry Prize and in 2012, a Lifetime Recognition Award from the Griffin Trust. His literary papers are held by the National Library of Ireland.\\nHe is buried at the Cemetery of St Mary\\'s Church, Bellaghy, Northern Ireland. The headstone bears the epitaph \"Walk on air against your better judgement\", from one of his poems, \"The Gravel Walks\".\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nHeaney was born on 13 April 1939, at the family farmhouse called Mossbawn, between Castledawson and Toomebridge; he was the first of nine children. In 1953, his family moved to Bellaghy, a few miles away, which is now the family home. His father, Patrick Heaney (d. October 1986), was the eighth child of ten born to James and Sarah Heaney. Patrick was a farmer, but his real commitment was to cattle dealing, to which he was introduced by the uncles who had cared for him after the early death of his own parents.Heaney\\'s mother, Margaret Kathleen McCann (1911–1984), who bore nine children, came from the McCann family. Her uncles and relations were employed in the local linen mill, and her aunt had worked as a maid for the mill owner\\'s family. Heaney commented that his parentage contained both the Ireland of the cattle-herding Gaelic past and the Ulster of the Industrial Revolution; he considered this to have been a significant tension in his background. Heaney attended Anahorish Primary School; when he was twelve years old, he won a scholarship to St Columb\\'s College, a Roman Catholic boarding school in Derry. Heaney\\'s younger brother, Christopher, was killed in a road accident while Heaney was studying at St Columb\\'s. The poems \"Mid-Term Break\" and \"The Blackbird of Glanmore\" are related to his brother\\'s death.Heaney played football for Castledawson, the club in the area of his birth, as a boy, and did not change to Bellaghy when his family moved there.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1957–1969 ===\\n\\nIn 1957, Heaney travelled to Belfast to study English Language and Literature at Queen\\'s University Belfast. While there, he found a copy of Ted Hughes\\'s Lupercal, which spurred him to write poetry. \"Suddenly, the matter of contemporary poetry was the material of my own life,\" he said. He graduated in 1961 with a First Class Honours degree.During teacher training at St Joseph\\'s Teacher Training College in Belfast (now merged with St Mary\\'s, University College), Heaney went on a placement to St Thomas\\' secondary Intermediate School in west Belfast. The headmaster of this school was the writer Michael McLaverty from County Monaghan, who introduced Heaney to the poetry of Patrick Kavanagh. With McLaverty\\'s mentorship, Heaney first started to publish poetry in 1962. Sophia Hillan describes how McLaverty was like a foster father to the younger Belfast poet. In the introduction to McLaverty\\'s Collected Works, Heaney summarised the poet\\'s contribution and influence: \"His voice was modestly pitched, he never sought the limelight, yet for all that, his place in our literature is secure.\" Heaney\\'s poem Fosterage, in the sequence Singing School from North (1975), is dedicated to him.In 1963, Heaney became a lecturer at St Joseph\\'s, and in the spring of 1963, after contributing various articles to local magazines, he came to the attention of Philip Hobsbaum, then an English lecturer at Queen\\'s University. Hobsbaum set up a Belfast Group of local young poets (to mirror the success he had with the London group), and Heaney was able to meet other Belfast poets such as Derek Mahon and Michael Longley. In August 1965, he married Marie Devlin, a school teacher and native of Ardboe, County Tyrone. (Also a writer, Devlin published Over Nine Waves (1994), a collection of traditional Irish myths and legends.) Heaney\\'s first book, Eleven Poems, was published in November 1965 for the Queen\\'s University Festival.In 1966, Faber and Faber published Death of a Naturalist, his first major volume. This collection was met with much critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Gregory Award for Young Writers and the Geoffrey Faber Prize. Also in 1966, Heaney was appointed as a lecturer in Modern English Literature at Queen\\'s University Belfast. That year his first son, Michael, was born. A second son, Christopher, was born in 1968. That year Heaney and Michael Longley undertook a reading tour called Room to Rhyme, which increased awareness of the poet\\'s work. In 1969 he published his second major volume, Door into the Dark.\\n\\n\\n=== 1970–1984 ===\\n\\nAfter a spell as guest lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, Heaney returned in 1971 to Queen\\'s University. In 1972, Heaney left his lectureship at Belfast, moved to Wicklow in the Republic of Ireland, and began writing on a full-time basis. In the same year, he published Wintering Out. Over the next few years, Heaney began to give readings throughout Ireland, Great Britain and the United States. In 1975, Heaney published his fourth volume, North. A pamphlet of prose poems entitled Stations was published the same year.He became Head of English at Carysfort College in Dublin in 1976, and he moved with his family to Sandymount in that city. His next volume, Field Work, was published in 1979. Selected Poems 1965-1975 and Preoccupations: Selected Prose 1968–1978 were published in 1980. When Aosdána, the national Irish Arts Council, was established in 1981, Heaney was among those elected into its first group. (He was subsequently elected a Saoi, one of its five elders and its highest honour, in 1997).Also in 1981, Heaney traveled to the United States as a visiting professor at Harvard, where he was affiliated with Adams House. He was awarded two honorary doctorates, from Queen\\'s University and from Fordham University in New York City (1982). At the Fordham commencement ceremony on 23 May 1982, Heaney delivered his address as a 46-stanza poem entitled \"Verses for a Fordham Commencement.\"Born and educated in Northern Ireland, Heaney stressed that he was Irish and not British. Following the success of the Field Day Theatre Company\\'s production of Brian Friel\\'s Translations, the founders Brian Friel and Stephen Rea decided to make the company a permanent group. Heaney joined the company\\'s expanded Board of Directors in 1981. In autumn 1984, his mother, Margaret, died.\\n\\n\\n=== 1985–1999 ===\\n\\nHeaney received a tenure position at Harvard, becoming Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory (formerly Visiting Professor) 1985–1997, and the Ralph Waldo Emerson Poet in Residence at Harvard 1998–2006. In 1986, Heaney received a Litt.D. from Bates College. His father, Patrick, died in October the same year. The loss of both parents within two years affected Heaney deeply, and he expressed his grief in poems. In 1988, a collection of his critical essays, The Government of the Tongue, was published.\\nIn 1985 Heaney wrote the poem \"From the Republic of Conscience\" at the request of Amnesty International Ireland. He wanted to \"celebrate United Nations Day and the work of Amnesty\". The poem inspired the title of Amnesty International\\'s highest honor, the Ambassador of Conscience Award.In 1988, Heaney donated his lecture notes to the Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library (MARBL) of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, after giving the notable Ellmann Lecture in Modern Literature there.In 1989, Heaney was elected Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford, which he held for a five-year term to 1994. The chair does not require residence in Oxford. Throughout this period, he was dividing his time between Ireland and the United States. He also continued to give public readings. So well attended and keenly anticipated were these events that those who queued for tickets with such enthusiasm were sometimes dubbed \"Heaneyboppers\", suggesting an almost teenybopper fan base.In 1990, The Cure at Troy, his play based on Sophocles\\'s Philoctetes, was published to much acclaim. The next year, he published another volume of poetry, Seeing Things (1991). Heaney was named an Honorary Patron of the University Philosophical Society, Trinity College, Dublin, and was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (1991).In 1993, Heaney guest-edited The Mays Anthology, a collection of new writing from students at the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge. That same year, he was awarded the Dickinson College Arts Award and returned to the Pennsylvania college to deliver the commencement address and receive an honorary degree. He was scheduled to return to Dickinson again to receive the Harold and Ethel L. Stellfox Award—for a major literary figure—at the time of his death in 2013. Irish poet Paul Muldoon was named recipient of the award that year, partly in recognition of the close connection between the two poets.\\nHeaney was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995 for what the Nobel committee described as \"works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past\". He was on holiday in Greece with his wife when the news broke. Neither journalists nor his own children could reach him until he arrived at Dublin Airport two days later, although an Irish television camera traced him to Kalamata. Asked how he felt to have his name added to the Irish Nobel pantheon of W. B. Yeats, George Bernard Shaw and Samuel Beckett, Heaney responded: \"It\\'s like being a little foothill at the bottom of a mountain range. You hope you just live up to it. It\\'s extraordinary.\" He and his wife Marie were immediately taken from the airport to Áras an Uachtaráin for champagne with President Mary Robinson. He would refer to the prize discreetly as \"the N thing\" in personal exchanges with others.Heaney\\'s 1996 collection The Spirit Level won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award; he repeated the success in 1999 with  Beowulf: A New Verse Translation.Heaney was elected a Member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1996 and was admitted in 1997. In the same year, Heaney was elected Saoi of Aosdána. In 1998, Heaney was elected Honorary Fellow of Trinity College Dublin.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000s ===\\n\\nIn 2000, Heaney was awarded an honorary doctorate and delivered the commencement address at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2002, Heaney was awarded an honorary doctorate from Rhodes University and delivered a public lecture on \"The Guttural Muse\".In 2003, the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry was opened at Queen\\'s University Belfast. It houses the Heaney Media Archive, a record of Heaney\\'s entire oeuvre, along with a full catalogue of his radio and television presentations. That same year, Heaney decided to lodge a substantial portion of his literary archive at Emory University as a memorial to the work of William M. Chace, the university\\'s recently retired president. The Emory papers represented the largest repository of Heaney\\'s work (1964–2003). He donated these to help build their large existing archive of material from Irish writers including Yeats, Paul Muldoon, Ciaran Carson, Michael Longley and other members of The Belfast Group.In 2003, when asked if there was any figure in popular culture who aroused interest in poetry and lyrics, Heaney praised American rap artist Eminem from Detroit, saying, \"He has created a sense of what is possible. He has sent a voltage around a generation. He has done this not just through his subversive attitude but also his verbal energy.\" Heaney wrote the poem \"Beacons at Bealtaine\" to mark the 2004 EU Enlargement. He read the poem at a ceremony for the 25 leaders of the enlarged European Union, arranged by the Irish EU presidency.\\nIn August 2006, Heaney suffered a stroke. Although he recovered and joked, \"Blessed are the pacemakers\" when fitted with a heart monitor, he cancelled all public engagements for several months. He was in County Donegal at the time of the 75th birthday of Anne Friel, wife of playwright Brian Friel. He read the works of Henning Mankell, Donna Leon and Robert Harris while in hospital. Among his visitors was former President Bill Clinton.Heaney\\'s District and Circle won the 2006 T. S. Eliot Prize. In 2008, he became artist of honour in Østermarie, Denmark, and Seamus Heaney Stræde (street) was named after him. In 2009, Heaney was presented with an Honorary-Life Membership award from the University College Dublin (UCD) Law Society, in recognition of his remarkable role as a literary figure.Faber and Faber published Dennis O\\'Driscoll\\'s book Stepping Stones: Interviews with Seamus Heaney in 2008; this has been described as the nearest thing to an autobiography of Heaney. In 2009, Heaney was awarded the David Cohen Prize for Literature. He spoke at the West Belfast Festival 2010 in celebration of his mentor, the poet and novelist Michael McLaverty, who had helped Heaney to first publish his poetry.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010s ===\\nIn 2010, Faber published Human Chain, Heaney\\'s twelfth collection. Human Chain was awarded the Forward Poetry Prize for Best Collection, one of the major poetry prizes Heaney had never previously won, despite having been twice shortlisted. The book, published 44 years after the poet\\'s first, was inspired in part by Heaney\\'s stroke in 2006, which left him \"babyish\" and \"on the brink\". Poet and Forward judge Ruth Padel described the work as \"a collection of painful, honest and delicately weighted poems ... a wonderful and humane achievement.\" Writer Colm Tóibín described Human Chain as \"his best single volume for many years, and one that contains some of the best poems he has written... is a book of shades and memories, of things whispered, of journeys into the underworld, of elegies and translations, of echoes and silences.\" In October 2010, the collection was shortlisted for the T. S. Eliot Prize.\\nHeaney was named one of \"Britain\\'s top 300 intellectuals\" by The Observer in 2011, though the newspaper later published a correction acknowledging that \"several individuals who would not claim to be British\" had been featured, of which Heaney was one. That same year, he contributed translations of Old Irish marginalia for Songs of the Scribe, an album by Traditional Singer in Residence of the Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry, Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin.In December 2011, he donated his personal literary notes to the National Library of Ireland. Even though he admitted he would likely have earned a fortune by auctioning them, Heaney personally packed up the boxes of notes and drafts and, accompanied by his son Michael, delivered them to the National Library.In June 2012, Heaney accepted the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry\\'s Lifetime Recognition Award and gave a speech in honour of the award.Heaney was compiling a collection of his work in anticipation of Selected Poems 1988–2013 at the time of his death. The selection includes poems and writings from Seeing Things, The Spirit Level, the translation of Beowulf, Electric Light, District and Circle, and Human Chain (fall 2014).\\nIn February 2014, Emory University premiered Seamus Heaney: The Music of What Happens, the first major exhibition to celebrate the life and work of Seamus Heaney since his death.\\n The exhibit holds a display of the surface of Heaney\\'s personal writing desk that he used in the 1980s as well as old photographs and personal correspondence with other writers.\\nHeaney died in August 2013, during the exhibition\\'s curatorial process. Though the exhibit\\'s original vision to celebrate Heaney\\'s life and work remains at the forefront, there is a small section commemorating his death and its influence.In September 2015, it was announced that Heaney\\'s family would posthumously publish his translation of Book VI of The Aeneid in 2016.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nSeamus Heaney died in the Blackrock Clinic in Dublin on 30 August 2013, aged 74, following a short illness. After a fall outside a restaurant in Dublin, he entered hospital for a medical procedure, but died at 7:30 the following morning before it took place. His funeral was held in Donnybrook, Dublin, on the morning of 2 September 2013, and he was buried in the evening at his home village of Bellaghy, in the same graveyard as his parents, young brother, and other family members. His son Michael revealed at the funeral mass that his father texted his final words, \"Noli timere\" (Latin: \"Do not be afraid\"), to his wife, Marie, minutes before he died.His funeral was broadcast live the following day on RTÉ television and radio and was streamed internationally at RTÉ\\'s website. RTÉ Radio 1 Extra transmitted a continuous broadcast, from 8 a.m. to 9:15 p.m. on the day of the funeral, of his Collected Poems album, recorded by Heaney in 2009. His poetry collections sold out rapidly in Irish bookshops immediately following his death.Many tributes were paid to Heaney. President Michael D. Higgins said: \\n\\n...we in Ireland will once again get a sense of the depth and range of the contribution of Seamus Heaney to our contemporary world, but what those of us who have had the privilege of his friendship and presence will miss is the extraordinary depth and warmth of his personality...Generations of Irish people will have been familiar with Seamus\\' poems. Scholars all over the world will have gained from the depth of the critical essays, and so many rights organisations will want to thank him for all the solidarity he gave to the struggles within the republic of conscience.President Higgins also appeared live from Áras an Uachtaráin on the Nine O\\'Clock News in a five-minute segment in which he paid tribute to Seamus Heaney.Bill Clinton, former President of the United States, said: \\n\\nBoth his stunning work and his life were a gift to the world. His mind, heart, and his uniquely Irish gift for language made him our finest poet of the rhythms of ordinary lives and a powerful voice for peace...His wonderful work, like that of his fellow Irish Nobel Prize winners Shaw, Yeats, and Beckett, will be a lasting gift for all the world.\\nJosé Manuel Barroso, European Commission president, said: \\n\\nI am greatly saddened today to learn of the death of Seamus Heaney, one of the great European poets of our lifetime. ... The strength, beauty and character of his words will endure for generations to come and were rightly recognised with the Nobel Prize for Literature.Harvard University issued a statement: We are fortunate and proud to have counted Seamus Heaney as a revered member of the Harvard family. For us, as for people around the world, he epitomised the poet as a wellspring of humane insight and artful imagination, subtle wisdom and shining grace. We will remember him with deep affection and admiration.\\nPoet Michael Longley, a close friend of Heaney, said: \"I feel like I\\'ve lost a brother.\" Thomas Kinsella said he was shocked, but John Montague said he had known for some time that the poet was not well. Playwright Frank McGuinness called Heaney \"the greatest Irishman of my generation: he had no rivals.\" Colm Tóibín wrote: \"In a time of burnings and bombings Heaney used poetry to offer an alternative world.\" Gerald Dawe said he was \"like an older brother who encouraged you to do the best you could do\". Theo Dorgan said, \"[Heaney\\'s] work will pass into permanence. Everywhere I go there is real shock at this. Seamus was one of us.\" His publisher, Faber and Faber, noted that \"his impact on literary culture is immeasurable.\" Playwright Tom Stoppard said, \"Seamus never had a sour moment, neither in person nor on paper\". Andrew Motion, a former UK Poet Laureate and friend of Heaney, called him \"a great poet, a wonderful writer about poetry, and a person of truly exceptional grace and intelligence.\"Many memorial events were held, including a commemoration at Emory University, Harvard University, Oxford University and the Southbank Centre, London. Leading US poetry organisations also met in New York to commemorate the death.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Naturalism ===\\nAt one time, Heaney\\'s books made up two-thirds of the sales of living poets in the UK. His work often deals with the local surroundings of Ireland, particularly in Northern Ireland, where he was born and lived until young adulthood. Speaking of his early life and education, he commented, \"I learned that my local County Derry experience, which I had considered archaic and irrelevant to \\'the modern world\\', was to be trusted. They taught me that trust and helped me to articulate it.\" Death of a Naturalist (1966) and Door into the Dark (1969) mostly focus on the details of rural, parochial life.In a number of volumes, beginning with Door into the Dark (1969) and Wintering Out (1972), Heaney also spent a significant amount of time writing on the northern Irish bog. Particularly of note is the collection of bog body poems in North (1975), featuring mangled bodies preserved in the bog. In a review by Ciaran Carson, he said that the bog poems made Heaney into \"the laureate of violence—a mythmaker, an anthropologist of ritual killing...the world of megalithic doorways and charming noble barbarity.\" Poems such as \"Bogland\" and \"Bog Queen\" addressed political struggles directly for the first time.\\n\\n\\n=== Politics ===\\nAllusions to sectarian difference, widespread in Northern Ireland through his lifetime, can be found in his poems. His books Wintering Out (1973) and North (1975) seek to interweave commentary on the Troubles with a historical context and wider human experience. While some critics accused Heaney of being \"an apologist and a mythologiser\" of the violence, Blake Morrison suggests the poet has written poems directly about the Troubles as well as elegies for friends and acquaintances who have died in them; he has tried to discover a historical framework in which to interpret the current unrest; and he has taken on the mantle of public spokesman, someone looked to for comment and guidance... Yet he has also shown signs of deeply resenting this role, defending the right of poets to be private and apolitical, and questioning the extent to which poetry, however \"committed\", can influence the course of history.\\nShaun O\\'Connell in the New Boston Review notes that \"those who see Seamus Heaney as a symbol of hope in a troubled land are not, of course, wrong to do so, though they may be missing much of the undercutting complexities of his poetry, the backwash of ironies which make him as bleak as he is bright.\" O\\'Connell notes in his Boston Review critique of Station Island: \\n\\nAgain and again Heaney pulls back from political purposes; despite its emblems of savagery, Station Island lends no rhetorical comfort to Republicanism. Politic about politics, Station Island is less about a united Ireland than about a poet seeking religious and aesthetic unity.\\nHeaney is described by critic Terry Eagleton as \"an enlightened cosmopolitan liberal\", refusing to be drawn. Eagleton suggests: \"When the political is introduced... it is only in the context of what Heaney will or will not say.\" Reflections on what Heaney identifies as \"tribal conflict\" favour the description of people\\'s lives and their voices, drawing out the \"psychic landscape\". His collections often recall the assassinations of his family members and close friends, lynchings and bombings. Colm Tóibín wrote, \"throughout his career there have been poems of simple evocation and description. His refusal to sum up or offer meaning is part of his tact.\"Heaney published \"Requiem for the Croppies\", a poem that commemorates the Irish rebels of 1798, on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. He read the poem to both Catholic and Protestant audiences in Ireland. He commented, \"To read \\'Requiem for the Croppies\\' wasn\\'t to say ‘up the IRA’ or anything. It was silence-breaking rather than rabble-rousing.\" He stated, \"You don\\'t have to love it. You just have to permit it.\"He turned down the offer of laureateship of the United Kingdom, partly for political reasons, commenting, \"I’ve nothing against the Queen personally: I had lunch at the Palace once upon a time.\" He stated that his \"cultural starting point\" was \"off-centre\". A much-quoted statement was when he objected to being included in The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry (1982). Although he was born in Northern Ireland, his response to being included in the British anthology was delivered in his poem \"An Open Letter\":\\n\\n\\n=== Translation ===\\nHe was concerned, as a poet and a translator, with the English language as it is spoken in Ireland but also as spoken elsewhere and in other times; he explored Anglo-Saxon influences in his work and study. Critic W. S. Di Piero noted Whatever the occasion, childhood, farm life, politics and culture in Northern Ireland, other poets past and present, Heaney strikes time and again at the taproot of language, examining its genetic structures, trying to discover how it has served, in all its changes, as a culture bearer, a world to contain imaginations, at once a rhetorical weapon and nutriment of spirit. He writes of these matters with rare discrimination and resourcefulness, and a winning impatience with received wisdom. Heaney\\'s first translation was of the Irish lyric poem Buile Suibhne, published as Sweeney Astray: A Version from the Irish (1984). He took up this character and connection in poems published in Station Island (1984). Heaney\\'s prize-winning translation of Beowulf (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2000, Whitbread Book of the Year Award) was considered groundbreaking in its use of modern language melded with the original Anglo-Saxon \"music\".\\n\\n\\n=== Plays and prose ===\\nHis plays include The Cure at Troy: A Version of Sophocles\\' Philoctetes (1991). Heaney\\'s 2004 play, The Burial at Thebes, suggests parallels between Creon and the foreign policies of the Bush administration.Heaney\\'s engagement with poetry as a necessary engine for cultural and personal change is reflected in his prose works The Redress of Poetry (1995) and Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971–2001 (2002).\\n\"When a poem rhymes,\" Heaney wrote, \"when a form generates itself, when a metre provokes consciousness into new postures, it is already on the side of life. When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity. When language does more than enough, as it does in all achieved poetry, it opts for the condition of overlife, and rebels at limit.\"He continues: \"The vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place\". Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate Czesław Miłosz.\\n\\n\\n=== Use in the school syllabus ===\\nHeaney\\'s work is used extensively in the school syllabus internationally, including the anthologies The Rattle Bag (1982) and The School Bag (1997) (both edited with Ted Hughes). Originally entitled The Faber Book of Verse for Younger People on the Faber contract, Hughes and Heaney decided the main purpose of The Rattle Bag was to offer enjoyment to the reader: \"Arbitrary riches.\" Heaney commented \"the book in our heads was something closer to The Fancy Free Poetry Supplement.\" It included work that they would have liked to encountered sooner in their own lives, as well as nonsense rhymes, ballad-type poems, riddles, folk songs and rhythmical jingles. Much familiar canonical work was not included, since they took it for granted that their audience would know the standard fare. Fifteen years later, The School Bag aimed at something different. The foreword stated that they wanted \"less of a carnival, more like a checklist.\" It included poems in English, Irish, Welsh, Scots and Scots Gaelic, together with work reflecting the African-American experience.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nThe Seamus Heaney HomePlace, in Bellaghy, is a literary and arts centre which commemorates Heaney\\'s legacy.In November 2019, the documentary Seamus Heaney and the music of what happens was aired on BBC Two. His wife Marie and his children talked about their family life and read some of the poems he wrote for them. For the first time, Heaney\\'s four brothers remembered their childhood and the shared experiences that inspired many of his finest poems.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\n\\n\\n== Prizes and honours ==\\n1966 Eric Gregory Award\\n1967 Cholmondeley Award\\n1968 Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize\\n1975 E.

       " {'Title': 'Derek Walcott',\n",
       "  'Full text': 'Sir Derek Alton Walcott, KCSL, OBE, OCC (23 January 1930 – 17 March 2017) was a Saint Lucian poet and playwright. He received the 1992 Nobel Prize in Literature. He was the University of Alberta\\'s first distinguished scholar in residence, where he taught undergraduate and graduate writing courses. He also served as Professor of Poetry at the University of Essex from 2010 to 2013. His works include the Homeric epic poem Omeros (1990), which many critics view \"as Walcott\\'s major achievement.\" In addition to winning the Nobel Prize, Walcott received many literary awards over the course of his career, including an Obie Award in 1971 for his play Dream on Monkey Mountain, a MacArthur Foundation \"genius\" award, a Royal Society of Literature Award, the Queen\\'s Medal for Poetry, the inaugural OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature, the 2011 T. S. Eliot Prize for his book of poetry White Egrets and the Griffin Trust For Excellence in Poetry Lifetime Recognition Award in 2015.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and childhood ==\\nWalcott was born and raised in Castries, Saint Lucia, in the West Indies, the son of Alix (Maarlin) and Warwick Walcott. He had a twin brother, the playwright Roderick Walcott, and a sister, Pamela Walcott. His family is of English, Dutch and African descent, reflecting the complex colonial history of the island that he explores in his poetry. His mother, a teacher, loved the arts and often recited poetry around the house. His father was a civil servant and a talented painter. He died when Walcott and his brother were one year old, and were left to be raised by their mother. Walcott was brought up in Methodist schools. His mother, who was a teacher at a Methodist elementary school, provided her children with an environment where their talents could be nurtured. Walcott\\'s family was part of a minority Methodist community, who felt overshadowed by the dominant Catholic culture of the island established during French colonial rule.As a young man Walcott trained as a painter, mentored by Harold Simmons, whose life as a professional artist provided an inspiring example for him.  Walcott greatly admired Cézanne and Giorgione and sought to learn from them. Walcott\\'s painting was later exhibited at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in New York City, along with the art of other writers, in a 2007 exhibition named \"The Writer\\'s Brush: Paintings and Drawing by Writers\".He studied as a writer, becoming \"an elated, exuberant poet madly in love with English\" and strongly influenced by modernist poets such as T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Walcott had an early sense of a vocation as a writer. In the poem \"Midsummer\" (1984), he wrote:\\n\\nAt 14, Walcott published his first poem, a Miltonic, religious poem, in the newspaper The Voice of St Lucia. An English Catholic priest condemned the Methodist-inspired poem as blasphemous in a response printed in the newspaper. By 19, Walcott had self-published his first two collections with the aid of his mother, who paid for the printing: 25 Poems (1948) and Epitaph for the Young: XII Cantos (1949).  He sold copies to his friends and covered the costs. He later commented:\\n\\nI went to my mother and said, \"I’d like to publish a book of poems, and I think it\\'s going to cost me two hundred dollars.\" She was just a seamstress and a schoolteacher, and I remember her being very upset because she wanted to do it. Somehow she got it—a lot of money for a woman to have found on her salary. She gave it to me, and I sent off to Trinidad and had the book printed. When the books came back I would sell them to friends. I made the money back.\\nThe influential Bajan poet Frank Collymore critically supported Walcott\\'s early work.After getting his high school education from St. Mary\\'s College, he received a scholarship to study at the University College of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nAfter graduation, Walcott moved to Trinidad in 1953, where he became a critic, teacher and journalist. He founded the Trinidad Theatre Workshop in 1959 and remained active with its board of directors.Exploring the Caribbean and its history in a colonialist and post-colonialist context, his collection In a Green Night: Poems 1948–1960 (1962) attracted international attention. His play Dream on Monkey Mountain (1970) was produced on NBC-TV in the United States the year it was published. Makak is the protagonist in this play; and \"Makak‟s condition represents the condition of the colonized natives under the oppressive forces of the powerful colonizers\".  In 1971 it was produced by the Negro Ensemble Company off-Broadway in New York City; it won an Obie Award that year for \"Best Foreign Play\". The following year, Walcott won an OBE from the British government for his work.He was hired as a teacher by Boston University in the United States, where he founded the Boston Playwrights\\' Theatre in 1981. That year he also received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in the United States.  Walcott taught literature and writing at Boston University for more than two decades, publishing new books of poetry and plays on a regular basis. Walcott retired from his position at Boston University in 2007. He became friends with other poets, including the Russian expatriate Joseph Brodsky, who lived and worked in the U.S. after being exiled in the 1970s, and the Irishman Seamus Heaney, who also taught in Boston.His epic poem Omeros (1990), which loosely echoes and refers to characters from the Iliad, has been critically praised \"as Walcott\\'s major achievement.\" The book received praise from publications such as The Washington Post and The New York Times Book Review, which chose Omeros as one of its \"Best Books of 1990\".Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992, the second Caribbean writer to receive the honour after Saint-John Perse, who was born in Guadeloupe, received the award in 1960. The Nobel committee described Walcott\\'s work as \"a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment\". He won an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2004.\\nHis later poetry collections include Tiepolo\\'s Hound (2000), illustrated with copies of his watercolors; The Prodigal (2004), and White Egrets (2010), which received the T.S. Eliot Prize and the 2011 OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature.In 2009, Walcott began a three-year distinguished scholar-in-residence position at the University of Alberta.  In 2010, he became Professor of Poetry at the University of Essex.As a part of St Lucia\\'s Independence Day celebrations, in February 2016, he became one of the first knights of the Order of Saint Lucia.\\n\\n\\n== Allegations of Sexual Harassment ==\\nIn 1982 a Harvard sophomore accused Walcott of sexual harassment in September 1981. She alleged that after she refused a sexual advance from him, she was given the only C in the class. In 1996 a student at Boston University sued Walcott for sexual harassment and \"offensive sexual physical contact\". The two reached a settlement.In 2009, Walcott was a leading candidate for the position of Oxford Professor of Poetry. He withdrew his candidacy after reports of the accusations against him of sexual harassment from 1981 and 1996.When the media learned that pages from an American book on the topic were sent anonymously to a number of Oxford academics, this aroused their interest in the university decisions.Ruth Padel, also a leading candidate, was elected to the post. Within days, The Daily Telegraph reported that she had alerted journalists to the harassment cases. Under severe media and academic pressure, Padel resigned. Padel was the first woman to be elected to the Oxford post, and some journalists attributed the criticism of her to misogyny and a gender war at Oxford. They said that a male poet would not have been so criticized, as she had reported published information, not rumour.Numerous respected poets, including Seamus Heaney and Al Alvarez, published a letter of support for Walcott in The Times Literary Supplement, and criticized the press furore. Other commentators suggested that both poets were casualties of the media interest in an internal university affair, because the story \"had everything, from sex claims to allegations of character assassination\". Simon Armitage and other poets expressed regret at Padel\\'s resignation.\\n\\n\\n== Writing ==\\n\\n\\n=== Themes ===\\nMethodism and spirituality have played a significant role from the beginning in Walcott\\'s work. He commented, \"I have never separated the writing of poetry from prayer. I have grown up believing it is a vocation, a religious vocation.\" Describing his writing process, he wrote, \"the body feels it is melting into what it has seen… the \\'I\\' not being important. That is the ecstasy...Ultimately, it\\'s what Yeats says: \\'Such a sweetness flows into the breast that we laugh at everything and everything we look upon is blessed.\\' That’s always there. It’s a benediction, a transference. It’s gratitude, really. The more of that a poet keeps, the more genuine his nature.\" He also notes, \"if one thinks a poem is coming on...you do make a retreat, a withdrawal into some kind of silence that cuts out everything around you. What you’re taking on is really not a renewal of your identity but actually a renewal of your anonymity.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Influences ===\\nWalcott said his writing was influenced by the work of the American poets, Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop, who were also friends.\\n\\n\\n=== Playwriting ===\\nHe published more than twenty plays, the majority of which have been produced by the Trinidad Theatre Workshop and have also been widely staged elsewhere. Many of them address, either directly or indirectly, the liminal status of the West Indies in the post-colonial period. Through poetry he also explores the paradoxes and complexities of this legacy.\\n\\n\\n=== Essays ===\\nIn his 1970 essay \"What the Twilight Says: An Overture\", discussing art and theatre in his native region (from Dream on Monkey Mountain and Other Plays), Walcott reflects on the West Indies as colonized space.  He discusses the problems for an artist of a region with little in the way of truly indigenous forms, and with little national or nationalist identity. He states: \"We are all strangers here... Our bodies think in one language and move in another\". The epistemological effects of colonization inform plays such as Ti-Jean and his Brothers. Mi-Jean, one of the eponymous brothers, is shown to have much information, but to truly know nothing. Every line Mi-Jean recites is rote knowledge gained from the coloniser; he is unable to synthesize it or apply it to his life as a colonised person.Walcott notes of growing up in West Indian culture:\\n\\nWhat we were deprived of was also our privilege. There was a great joy in making a world that so far, up to then, had been undefined... My generation of West Indian writers has felt such a powerful elation at having the privilege of writing about places and people for the first time and, simultaneously, having behind them the tradition of knowing how well it can be done—by a Defoe, a Dickens, a Richardson.\\nWalcott identified as \"absolutely a Caribbean writer\", a pioneer, helping to make sense of the legacy of deep colonial damage. In such poems as \"The Castaway\" (1965) and in the play Pantomime (1978), he uses the metaphors of shipwreck and Crusoe to describe the culture and what is required of artists after colonialism and slavery: both the freedom and the challenge to begin again, salvage the best of other cultures and make something new. These images recur in later work as well. He writes: \"If we continue to sulk and say, Look at what the slave-owner did, and so forth, we will never mature. While we sit moping or writing morose poems and novels that glorify a non-existent past, then time passes us by.\"\\n\\n\\n== Omeros ==\\n\\nWalcott\\'s epic book-length poem Omeros was published in 1990 to critical acclaim. The poem very loosely echoes and references Homer and some of his major characters from The Iliad. Some of the poem\\'s major characters include the island fishermen Achille and Hector, the retired English officer Major Plunkett and his wife Maud, the housemaid Helen, the blind man Seven Seas (who symbolically represents Homer), and the author himself.Although the main narrative of the poem takes place on the island of St. Lucia, where Walcott was born and raised, Walcott also includes scenes from Brookline, Massachusetts (where Walcott was living and teaching at the time of the poem\\'s composition), and the character Achille imagines a voyage from Africa onto a slave ship that is headed for the Americas; also, in Book Five of the poem, Walcott narrates some of his travel experiences in a variety of cities around the world, including Lisbon, London, Dublin, Rome, and Toronto.Composed in a variation on terza rima, the work explores the themes that run throughout Walcott\\'s oeuvre: the beauty of the islands, the colonial burden, the fragmentation of Caribbean identity, and the role of the poet in a post-colonial world.\\n\\n\\n=== Nobel Prize in Literature ===\\nDerek Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1992, two years after publishing the epic poem \"Omeros.\" He was known for writing about \"the harsh legacy of colonialism and the complexities of living and writing in two cultural worlds.\" His poetic voice reflected a blend of his ear for the English language and his sense of his own people.Stephen Breslow explained that he and the Swedish Academy chose Derek Walcott for the Nobel Laureate in Literature because his work had \"a strong regional voice that transcends its topical locality, through the depth and breadth of its poetic resonance and through its global human implication.\" It was Walcott\\'s ability to be more than just \"exotic\" that brought his work critical attention. Breslow explains that \"Walcott has merged a profound, rhapsodic reverie upon his remote birthplace – its people, its landscape, and its history – with the central, classical tradition of Western civilization.\" This ability shows the importance of multiculturalism and literary mastery to the Swedish Academy. Walcott\\'s works represent how different cultures can enrich one another to produce even more compelling works.In his Nobel acceptance speech, Walcott describes life on Antilles and what it means to discover identity. He describes all of the \"broken fragments\" of his \"diasporic\" identity. People need books, he says, but they are not enough to encompass all that a culture is. Walcott says that \"the visible poetry of the Antilles, then. [is] Survival\" because \"all of the Antilles, every island, is an effort of memory; every mind, every racial biography culminating in amnesia and fog.\" He encompasses the diasporic identity found in Caribbean Literature by looking at how insignificant he feels because he cannot, alone, fully bring together a cultural identity.\\n\\n\\n=== Criticism and praise ===\\nWalcott\\'s work has received praise from major poets including Robert Graves, who wrote that Walcott \"handles English with a closer understanding of its inner magic than most, if not any, of his contemporaries\", and Joseph Brodsky, who praised Walcott\\'s work, writing: \"For almost forty years his throbbing and relentless lines kept arriving in the English language like tidal waves, coagulating into an archipelago of poems without which the map of modern literature would effectively match wallpaper. He gives us more than himself or \\'a world\\'; he gives us a sense of infinity embodied in the language.\" Walcott noted that he, Brodsky, and the Irish poet Seamus Heaney, who all taught in the United States, were a band of poets \"outside the American experience\".\\nThe poetry critic William Logan critiqued Walcott\\'s work in a New York Times book review of Walcott\\'s Selected Poems. While he praised Walcott\\'s writing in Sea Grapes and The Arkansas Testament, Logan had mostly negative things to say about Walcott\\'s poetry, calling Omeros \"clumsy\" and Another Life \"pretentious.\" He concluded with \"No living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished than Walcott, though few individual poems seem destined to be remembered.\"Most reviews of Walcott\\'s work are more positive. For instance, in The New Yorker review of The Poetry of Derek Walcott, Adam Kirsch had high praise for Walcott\\'s oeuvre, describing his style in the following manner:\\n\\nBy combining the grammar of vision with the freedom of metaphor, Walcott produces a beautiful style that is also a philosophical style. People perceive the world on dual channels, Walcott’s verse suggests, through the senses and through the mind, and each is constantly seeping into the other. The result is a state of perpetual magical thinking, a kind of Alice in Wonderland world where concepts have bodies and landscapes are always liable to get up and start talking.\\nKirsch calls Another Life Walcott\\'s \"first major peak\" and analyzes the painterly qualities of Walcott\\'s imagery from his earliest work through to later books like Tiepolo\\'s Hound. He also explores the post-colonial politics in Walcott\\'s work, calling him \"the postcolonial writer par excellence\". Kirsch calls the early poem \"A Far Cry from Africa\" a turning point in Walcott\\'s development as a poet. Like Logan, Kirsch is critical of Omeros, which he believes Walcott fails to successfully sustain over its entirety. Although Omeros is the volume of Walcott\\'s that usually receives the most critical praise, Kirsch believes Midsummer to be his best book.His poetry, as spoken performance, appears briefly in the sampled sounds in the music album of the group Dreadzone. Their track entitled \"Captain Dread\" from the album Second Light incorporates the fourth verse of Walcott\\'s 1990 poem \"The Schooner Flight\".\\nIn 2013 Dutch filmmaker Ida Does released Poetry is an Island, a feature documentary film about Walcott\\'s life and the ever-present influence of his birthplace of St Lucia.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1954 Walcott married Fay Moston, a secretary, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1959. They had a son, the St Lucian painter Peter Walcott. Walcott married a second time to Margaret Maillard in 1962, who worked as an almoner in a hospital, and together they had two daughters, Elizabeth Walcott-Hackshaw and Anna Walcott-Hardy, before divorcing in 1976. In 1976, Walcott married for a third time, to actress Norline Metivier; they divorced in 1993. His companion until his death was Sigrid Nama, a former art gallery owner.Walcott was also known for his passion for travelling to countries around the world. He split his time between New York, Boston, and St. Lucia, and incorporated the influences of different areas into his pieces of work.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\n\\nWalcott died at his home in Cap Estate, St. Lucia, on 17 March 2017. He was 87. He was given a state funeral on Saturday, 25 March, with a service at the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Castries and burial at Morne Fortune.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nIn 1993, a public square and park located in central Castries, Saint Lucia, was named Derek Walcott Square.The Saint Lucia National Trust acquired Walcott\\'s childhood home at 17 Chaussée Road, Castries, in November 2015, renovating it before opening it to the public as Walcott House in January 2016.In January 2020 the Sir Arthur Lewis Community College in St. Lucia announced that Walcott\\'s books on Caribbean Literature and poetry have been donated to its Library.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honours ==\\n1969 Cholmondeley Award\\n1971 Obie Award for Best Foreign Play (for Dream on Monkey Mountain)\\n1972 Officer of the Order of the British Empire\\n1981 MacArthur Foundation Fellowship (\"genius award\")\\n1988 Queen\\'s Gold Medal for Poetry\\n1990 Arts Council of Wales International Writers Prize\\n1990 W.

       "  'Full text': 'Zadie Adeline Smith FRSL (born 25 October 1975) is an English novelist, essayist, and short-story writer. Her debut novel, White Teeth (2000), immediately became a best-seller and won a number of awards. She has been a tenured professor in the Creative Writing faculty of New York University since September 2010.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nSmith was born in Willesden in the north-west London borough of Brent to a Jamaican mother, Yvonne Bailey, and an English father, Harvey Smith, who was 30 years his wife\\'s senior. At the age of 14, she changed her name from Sadie to Zadie.Smith\\'s mother grew up in Jamaica and emigrated to England in 1969. Smith\\'s parents divorced when she was a teenager. She has a half-sister, a half-brother, and two younger brothers (one is the rapper and stand-up comedian Doc Brown, and the other is the rapper Luc Skyz). As a child, Smith was fond of tap dancing, and in her teenage years, she considered a career in musical theatre. While at university, Smith earned money as a jazz singer, and wanted to become a journalist. Despite earlier ambitions, literature emerged as her principal interest.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nSmith attended the local state schools, Malorees Junior School and Hampstead Comprehensive School, and King\\'s College, Cambridge, where she studied English literature. In an interview with The Guardian in 2000, Smith corrected a newspaper assertion that she left Cambridge with a double First. \"Actually, I got a Third in my Part Ones\", she said. She graduated with upper second-class honours.Smith seems to have been rejected for a place in the Cambridge Footlights by the popular British comedy double act Mitchell and Webb, while all three were studying at Cambridge University in the 1990s.At Cambridge, Smith published a number of short stories in a collection of new student writing called The Mays Anthology. They attracted the attention of a publisher, who offered her a contract for her first novel. Smith decided to contact a literary agent and was taken on by A. P. Watt. Smith returned to guest-edit the anthology in 2001.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nSmith\\'s début novel White Teeth was introduced to the publishing world in 1997, before it was completed. On the basis of a partial manuscript, an auction for the rights was begun; Hamish Hamilton won. Smith completed White Teeth during her final year at Cambridge. Published in 2000, the novel immediately became a best-seller. It was praised internationally and won a number of awards, among them the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and the Betty Trask Award. The novel was adapted for television in 2002. Smith served as writer-in-residence at the ICA in London and subsequently published, as editor, an anthology of sex writing, Piece of Flesh, as the culmination of this role.\\nIn interviews, Smith reported that the hype surrounding her first novel had caused her to suffer briefly from writer\\'s block. Nevertheless, her second novel, The Autograph Man, was published in 2002 and was a commercial success, although it was not as well received by critics as White Teeth.\\nAfter the publication of The Autograph Man, Smith visited the United States as a Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. She started work on a still-unreleased book of essays, The Morality of the Novel (a.k.a. Fail Better), in which she considers a selection of 20th-century writers through the lens of moral philosophy. Some portions of this book presumably appear in the essay collection Changing My Mind, published in November 2009.Smith\\'s third novel, On Beauty, was published in September 2005. It is set largely in and around Greater Boston. It attracted more acclaim than The Autograph Man: it was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and won the 2006 Orange Prize for Fiction and the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.Later in the same year, Smith published Martha and Hanwell, a book that pairs two short stories about two troubled characters, originally published in Granta and The New Yorker respectively. Penguin published Martha and Hanwell with a new introduction by the author as part of their pocket series to celebrate their 70th birthday. The first story, \"Martha, Martha\", deals with Smith\\'s familiar themes of race and postcolonial identity, while \"Hanwell in Hell\" is about a man struggling to cope with the death of his wife. In December 2008 she guest-edited the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.After teaching fiction at Columbia University School of the Arts, Smith joined New York University as a tenured professor of fiction in 2010.Smith\\'s novel NW was published in 2012. It is set in the Kilburn area of north-west London, the title being a reference to the local postcode, NW6. NW was shortlisted for the Royal Society of Literature\\'s Ondaatje Prize and the Women\\'s Prize for Fiction. NW was made into a BBC television film directed by Saul Dibb and adapted by Rachel Bennette. Starring Nikki Amuka-Bird and Phoebe Fox, it was broadcast on BBC Two on 14 November 2016.In 2015 it was announced that Smith, along with her husband Nick Laird, was writing the screenplay for a science fiction movie to be directed by French filmmaker Claire Denis. Smith later said that her involvement had been overstated and that she had simply helped to polish the English dialogue for the film.Smith\\'s fifth novel, Swing Time, was published in November 2016. It was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize 2017.\\nBetween March and October 2011, Smith was the monthly New Books reviewer for Harper\\'s Magazine. She is also a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books. In 2010, The Guardian newspaper asked Smith for her \"10 rules for writing fiction\". Among them she declared: \"Tell the truth through whichever veil comes to hand – but tell it. Resign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never being satisfied.\"Smith\\'s first collection of short stories, Grand Union, was published on October 8th, 2019.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nSmith met Nick Laird at Cambridge University. They married in 2004 in the Chapel of King\\'s College, Cambridge. Smith dedicated On Beauty to \"my dear Laird\". She also uses his name in passing in White Teeth: \"An\\' all the good-lookin\\' men, all the rides like your man Nicky Laird, they\\'re all dead.\"The couple lived in Rome, Italy, from November 2006 to 2007, and are now based in New York City and Queen\\'s Park, London. They have two children, Katherine (Kit) and Harvey (Hal).Smith describes herself as \"unreligious\", and was not raised in a religion, although retains a \"curiosity\" about the role religion plays in others\\' lives. In an essay exploring humanist and existentialist views of death and dying, Smith characterises her worldview as that of a \"sentimental humanist\".\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Novels ===\\nWhite Teeth (2000)\\nThe Autograph Man (2002)\\nOn Beauty (2005)\\nNW (2012)\\nSwing Time (2016)\\n\\n\\n=== Plays ===\\nThe Wife of Willesden (announced in 2019)\\n\\n\\n=== Short fiction ===\\nCollections\"Martha and Hanwell\" (2005)\\nGrand Union: Stories (2019)Stories\\n\\n\\n=== Non-fiction ===\\nChanging My Mind: Occasional Essays (2009)\\nStop What You\\'re Doing and Read This!
