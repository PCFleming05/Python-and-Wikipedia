       "'William Wordsworth (7 April 1770 – 23 April 1850) was an English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication Lyrical Ballads (1798).\\nWordsworth\\'s magnum opus is generally considered to be The Prelude, a semi-autobiographical poem of his early years that he revised and expanded a number of times. It was posthumously titled and published by his wife in the year of his death, before which it was generally known as \"the poem to Coleridge\".Wordsworth was Britain\\'s poet laureate from 1843 until his death from pleurisy on 23 April 1850.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nThe second of five children born to John Wordsworth and Ann Cookson, William Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in what is now named Wordsworth House in Cockermouth, Cumberland, part of the scenic region in northwestern England known as the Lake District. William\\'s sister, the poet and diarist Dorothy Wordsworth, to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptised together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest, who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who went to sea and died in 1805 when the ship of which he was captain, the Earl of Abergavenny, was wrecked off the south coast of England; and Christopher, the youngest, who entered the Church and rose to be Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.Wordsworth\\'s father was a legal representative of James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and, through his connections, lived in a large mansion in the small town. He was frequently away from home on business, so the young William and his siblings had little involvement with him and remained distant from him until his death in 1783. However, he did encourage William in his reading, and in particular set him to commit large portions of verse to memory, including works by Milton, Shakespeare and Spenser. William was also allowed to use his father\\'s library.\\nWilliam also spent time at his mother\\'s parents\\' house in Penrith, Cumberland, where he was exposed to the moors, but did not get along with his grandparents or his uncle, who also lived there. His hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.Wordsworth was taught to read by his mother and attended, first, a tiny school of low quality in Cockermouth, then a school in Penrith for the children of upper-class families, where he was taught by Ann Birkett, who insisted on instilling in her students traditions that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day and Shrove Tuesday. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the Spectator, but little else. It was at the school in Penrith that he met the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who later became his wife.After the death of Wordsworth\\'s mother, in 1778, his father sent him to Hawkshead Grammar School in Lancashire (now in Cumbria) and sent Dorothy to live with relatives in Yorkshire. She and William did not meet again for another nine years.\\nWordsworth made his debut as a writer in 1787 when he published a sonnet in The European Magazine. That same year he began attending St John\\'s College, Cambridge. He received his BA degree in 1791. He returned to Hawkshead for the first two summers of his time at Cambridge, and often spent later holidays on walking tours, visiting places famous for the beauty of their landscape. In 1790 he went on a walking tour of Europe, during which he toured the Alps extensively, and visited nearby areas of France, Switzerland, and Italy.\\n\\n\\n== Relationship with Annette Vallon ==\\nIn November 1791, Wordsworth visited Revolutionary France and became enchanted with the Republican movement. He fell in love with a French woman, Annette Vallon, who, in 1792, gave birth to their daughter Caroline. Financial problems and Britain\\'s tense relations with France forced him to return to England alone the following year. The circumstances of his return and his subsequent behaviour raised doubts as to his declared wish to marry Annette. However, he supported her and his daughter as best he could in later life. The Reign of Terror left Wordsworth thoroughly disillusioned with the French Revolution and the outbreak of armed hostilities between Britain and France prevented him from seeing Annette and his daughter for some years.\\nWith the Peace of Amiens again allowing travel to France, in 1802 Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited Annette and Caroline in Calais. The purpose of the visit was to prepare Annette for the fact of his forthcoming marriage to Mary Hutchinson. Afterwards he wrote the sonnet \"It is a beauteous evening, calm and free\", recalling a seaside walk with the 9-year-old Caroline, whom he had never seen before that visit. Mary was anxious that Wordsworth should do more for Caroline. Upon Caroline\\'s marriage, in 1816, Wordsworth settled £30 a year on her (equivalent to £1,360 as of the year 2000), payments which continued until 1835, when they were replaced by a capital settlement.\\n\\n\\n== First publication and Lyrical Ballads ==\\n The year 1793 saw the first publication of poems by Wordsworth, in the collections An Evening Walk and Descriptive Sketches. In 1795 he received a legacy of £900 from Raisley Calvert and became able to pursue a career as a poet.\\nIt was also in 1795 that he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. For two years from 1795, William and his sister Dorothy lived at Racedown House in Dorset—a property of the Pinney family—to the west of Pilsdon Pen. They walked in the area for about two hours every day, and the nearby hills consoled Dorothy as she pined for the fells of her native Lakeland. She wrote,\\n\\n\"We have hills which, seen from a distance almost take the character of mountains, some cultivated nearly to their summits, others in their wild state covered with furze and broom. These delight me the most as they remind me of our native wilds.\"\\nIn 1797, the pair moved to Alfoxton House, Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge\\'s home in Nether Stowey. Together Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced Lyrical Ballads (1798), an important work in the English Romantic movement. The volume gave neither Wordsworth\\'s nor Coleridge\\'s name as author. One of Wordsworth\\'s most famous poems, \"Tintern Abbey\", was published in this collection, along with Coleridge\\'s \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". The second edition, published in 1800, had only Wordsworth listed as the author, and included a preface to the poems. It was augmented significantly in the next edition, published in 1802. In this preface, which some scholars consider a central work of Romantic literary theory, Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of verse, one that is based on the ordinary language \"really used by men\" while avoiding the poetic diction of much 18th-century verse. Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility\", and calls his own poems in the book \"experimental\". A fourth and final edition of Lyrical Ballads was published in 1805.\\n\\n\\n== The Borderers ==\\nBetween 1795–1797, Wordsworth wrote his only play, The Borderers, a verse tragedy set during the reign of King Henry III of England, when Englishmen in the North Country came into conflict with Scottish border reivers. He attempted to get the play staged in November 1797, but it was rejected by Thomas Harris, the manager of the Covent Garden Theatre, who proclaimed it \"impossible that the play should succeed in the representation\". The rebuff was not received lightly by Wordsworth and the play was not published until 1842, after substantial revision.\\n\\n\\n== Germany and move to the Lake District ==\\nWordsworth, Dorothy and Coleridge travelled to Germany in the autumn of 1798. While Coleridge was intellectually stimulated by the journey, its main effect on Wordsworth was to produce homesickness. During the harsh winter of 1798–99 Wordsworth lived with Dorothy in Goslar, and, despite extreme stress and loneliness, began work on the autobiographical piece that was later titled The Prelude. He wrote a number of other famous poems in Goslar, including \"The Lucy poems\". In the Autumn of 1799, Wordsworth and his sister returned to England and visited the Hutchinson family at Sockburn. When Coleridge arrived back in England he travelled to the North with their publisher Joseph Cottle to meet Wordsworth and undertake a proposed tour of the Lake District. This was the immediate cause of the brother and sister\\'s settling at Dove Cottage in Grasmere in the Lake District, this time with another poet, Robert Southey, nearby. Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the \"Lake Poets\". Throughout this period many of Wordsworth\\'s poems revolved around themes of death, endurance, separation and grief.\\n\\n\\n== Marriage and children ==\\n\\nIn 1802, Lowther\\'s heir, William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale, paid the £4,000 owed to Wordsworth\\'s father through Lowther\\'s failure to pay his aide. It was this repayment that afforded Wordsworth the financial means to marry. On 4 October, following his visit with Dorothy to France to arrange matters with Annette, Wordsworth married his childhood friend Mary Hutchinson. Dorothy continued to live with the couple and grew close to Mary. The following year Mary gave birth to the first of five children, three of whom predeceased her and William:\\n\\nJohn Wordsworth (18 June 1803 – 1875). Married four times:\\nIsabella Curwen (died 1848) had six children: Jane, Henry, William, John, Charles and Edward.\\nHelen Ross (died 1854). No children.\\nMary Ann Dolan (died after 1858) had one daughter Dora (born 1858).\\nMary Gamble. No children.\\nDora Wordsworth (16 August 1804 – 9 July 1847). Married Edward Quillinan in 1841.\\nThomas Wordsworth (15 June 1806 – 1 December 1812).\\nCatherine Wordsworth (6 September 1808 – 4 June 1812).\\nWilliam \"Willy\" Wordsworth (12 May 1810 – 1883). Married Fanny Graham and had four children: Mary Louisa, William, Reginald, Gordon\\n\\n\\n== Autobiographical work and Poems, in Two Volumes ==\\nWordsworth had for years been making plans to write a long philosophical poem in three parts, which he intended to call The Recluse. In 1798–99 he started an autobiographical poem, which he referred to as the \"poem to Coleridge\" and which he planned would serve as an appendix to a larger work called The Recluse. In 1804 he began expanding this autobiographical work, having decided to make it a prologue rather than an appendix. He completed this work, now generally referred to as the first version of The Prelude, in 1805, but refused to publish such a personal work until he had completed the whole of The Recluse. The death of his brother John, also in 1805, affected him strongly and may have influenced his decisions about these works.\\n\\nWordsworth\\'s philosophical allegiances as articulated in The Prelude and in such shorter works as \"Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey\" have been a source of critical debate. It was long supposed that Wordsworth relied chiefly on Coleridge for philosophical guidance, but more recently scholars have suggested that Wordsworth\\'s ideas may have been formed years before he and Coleridge became friends in the mid-1790s. In particular, while he was in revolutionary Paris in 1792, the 22-year-old Wordsworth made the acquaintance of the mysterious traveler John \"Walking\" Stewart (1747–1822), who was nearing the end of his thirty years of wandering, on foot, from Madras, India, through Persia and Arabia, across Africa and Europe, and up through the fledgling United States. By the time of their association, Stewart had published an ambitious work of original materialist philosophy entitled The Apocalypse of Nature (London, 1791), to which many of Wordsworth\\'s philosophical sentiments may well be indebted.\\nIn 1807 Wordsworth published Poems, in Two Volumes, including \"Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\". Up to this point Wordsworth was known only for Lyrical Ballads, and he hoped that this new collection would cement his reputation. Its reception was lukewarm, however.\\nIn 1810, Wordsworth and Coleridge were estranged over the latter\\'s opium addiction, and in 1812, his son Thomas died at the age of 6, six months after the death of 3-year-old Catherine. The following year he received an appointment as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland, and the stipend of £400 a year made him financially secure, albeit at the cost of political independence. In 1813, he and his family, including Dorothy, moved to Rydal Mount, Ambleside (between Grasmere and Rydal Water), where he spent the rest of his life.\\n\\n\\n== The Prospectus ==\\nIn 1814 Wordsworth published The Excursion as the second part of the three-part work The Recluse, even though he had not completed the first part or the third part, and never did. He did, however, write a poetic Prospectus to The Recluse in which he laid out the structure and intention of the whole work. The Prospectus contains some of Wordsworth\\'s most famous lines on the relation between the human mind and nature:\\n\\nSome modern critics suggest that there was a decline in his work beginning around the mid-1810s, perhaps because most of the concerns that characterised his early poems (loss, death, endurance, separation and abandonment) had been resolved in his writings and his life. By 1820, he was enjoying considerable success accompanying a reversal in the contemporary critical opinion of his earlier works.\\nFollowing the death of his friend the painter William Green in 1823, Wordsworth also mended his relations with Coleridge. The two were fully reconciled by 1828, when they toured the Rhineland together. Dorothy suffered from a severe illness in 1829 that rendered her an invalid for the remainder of her life. Coleridge and Charles Lamb both died in 1834, their loss being a difficult blow to Wordsworth. The following year saw the passing of James Hogg. Despite the death of many contemporaries, the popularity of his poetry ensured a steady stream of young friends and admirers to replace those he lost.\\n\\n\\n== Religious beliefs ==\\nWordsworth\\'s youthful political radicalism, unlike Coleridge\\'s, never led him to rebel against his religious upbringing. He remarked in 1812 that he was willing to shed his blood for the established Church of England, reflected in his Ecclesiastical Sketches of 1822. This religious conservatism also colours The Excursion (1814), a long poem that became extremely popular during the nineteenth century; it features three central characters, the Wanderer; the Solitary, who has experienced the hopes and miseries of the French Revolution; and the Pastor, who dominates the last third of the poem.\\n\\n\\n== Laureateship and other honours ==\\nWordsworth remained a formidable presence in his later years. In 1837, the Scottish poet and playwright Joanna Baillie reflected on her long acquaintance with Wordsworth. \"He looks like a man that one must not speak to unless one has some sensible thing to say. However he does occasionally converse cheerfully & well; and when one knows how benevolent & excellent he is, it disposes one to be very much pleased with him.\"In 1838, Wordsworth received an honorary doctorate in Civil Law from the University of Durham and the following year he was awarded the same honorary degree by the University of Oxford, when John Keble praised him as the \"poet of humanity\", praise greatly appreciated by Wordsworth. (It has been argued that Wordsworth was a great influence on Keble\\'s immensely popular book of devotional poetry, The Christian Year (1827).) In 1842, the government awarded him a Civil List pension of £300 a year.\\nFollowing the death of Robert Southey in 1843 Wordsworth became Poet Laureate. He initially refused the honour, saying that he was too old, but accepted when the Prime Minister, Robert Peel, assured him that \"you shall have nothing required of you\". Wordsworth thus became the only poet laureate to write no official verses. The sudden death of his daughter Dora in 1847 at age 42 was difficult for the aging poet to take and in his depression, he completely gave up writing new material.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\n\\nWilliam Wordsworth died at home at Rydal Mount from an aggravated case of pleurisy on 23 April 1850, and was buried at St Oswald\\'s Church, Grasmere. His widow, Mary, published his lengthy autobiographical \"Poem to Coleridge\" as The Prelude several months after his death. Though it failed to interest people at the time, it has since come to be widely recognised as his masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nWordsworth has appeared as a character in works of fiction, including:\\n\\nWilliam Kinsolving – Mister Christian. 1996\\nJasper Fforde – The Eyre Affair. 2001\\nVal McDermid – The Grave Tattoo. 2006\\nSue Limb –  The Wordsmiths at Gorsemere. 2008Isaac Asimov\\'s 1966 novelization of the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage sees Dr. Peter Duval quoting Wordsworth\\'s The Prelude as the miniaturized submarine sails through the cerebral fluid surrounding a human brain, comparing it to the \"strange seas of thought\".\\n\\n\\n== Major works ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of poets\\nLake Poets\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nJuliet Barker.

       "'Samuel Taylor Coleridge  (; 21 October 1772 – 25 July 1834) was an English poet, literary critic, philosopher and theologian who, with his friend William Wordsworth, was a founder of the Romantic Movement in England and a member of the Lake Poets.  He also shared volumes and collaborated with Charles Lamb, Robert Southey, and Charles Lloyd. He wrote the poems The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, as well as the major prose work Biographia Literaria. His critical work, especially on William Shakespeare, was highly influential, and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy to English-speaking culture. Coleridge coined many familiar words and phrases, including suspension of disbelief. He had a major influence on Ralph Waldo Emerson and American transcendentalism.\\nThroughout his adult life Coleridge had crippling bouts of anxiety and depression; it has been speculated that he had bipolar disorder, which had not been defined during his lifetime. He was physically unhealthy, which may have stemmed from a bout of rheumatic fever and other childhood illnesses. He was treated for these conditions with laudanum, which fostered a lifelong opium addiction.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\n\\nColeridge was born on 21 October 1772 in the Town of Ottery St Mary in Devon, England. Samuel\\'s father was the Reverend John Coleridge (1718–1781), the well-respected vicar of St Mary\\'s Church, Ottery St Mary and was headmaster of the King\\'s School, a free grammar school established by King Henry VIII (1509–1547) in the town. He had previously been master of Hugh Squier\\'s School in South Molton, Devon, and lecturer of nearby Molland.\\nJohn Coleridge had three children by his first wife. Samuel was the youngest of ten by the Reverend Mr. Coleridge\\'s second wife, Anne Bowden (1726–1809), probably the daughter of John Bowden, Mayor of South Molton, Devon, in 1726. Coleridge suggests that he \"took no pleasure in boyish sports\" but instead read \"incessantly\" and played by himself. After John Coleridge died in 1781, 8-year-old Samuel was sent to Christ\\'s Hospital, a charity school which was founded in the 16th century in Greyfriars, London, where he remained throughout his childhood, studying and writing poetry. At that school Coleridge became friends with Charles Lamb, a schoolmate, and studied the works of Virgil and William Lisle Bowles.\\nIn one of a series of autobiographical letters written to Thomas Poole, Coleridge wrote: \"At six years old I remember to have read Belisarius, Robinson Crusoe, and Philip Quarll – and then I found the Arabian Nights\\' Entertainments – one tale of which (the tale of a man who was compelled to seek for a pure virgin) made so deep an impression on me (I had read it in the evening while my mother was mending stockings) that I was haunted by spectres whenever I was in the dark – and I distinctly remember the anxious and fearful eagerness with which I used to watch the window in which the books lay – and whenever the sun lay upon them, I would seize it, carry it by the wall, and bask, and read.\"\\nColeridge seems to have appreciated his teacher, as he wrote in recollections of his school days in Biographia Literaria: \\n\\nI enjoyed the inestimable advantage of a very sensible, though at the same time, a very severe master [...] At the same time that we were studying the Greek Tragic Poets, he made us read Shakespeare and Milton as lessons: and they were the lessons too, which required most time and trouble to bring up, so as to escape his censure. I learnt from him, that Poetry, even that of the loftiest, and, seemingly, that of the wildest odes, had a logic of its own, as severe as that of science; and more difficult, because more subtle, more complex, and dependent on more, and more fugitive causes. [...] In our own English compositions (at least for the last three years of our school education) he showed no mercy to phrase, metaphor, or image, unsupported by a sound sense, or where the same sense might have been conveyed with equal force and dignity in plainer words... In fancy I can almost hear him now, exclaiming Harp? Harp? Lyre? Pen and ink, boy, you mean! Muse, boy, Muse? your Nurse\\'s daughter, you mean! Pierian spring? Oh aye! the cloister-pump, I suppose! [...] Be this as it may, there was one custom of our master\\'s, which I cannot pass over in silence, because I think it ... worthy of imitation. He would often permit our theme exercises, ... to accumulate, till each lad had four or five to be looked over. Then placing the whole number abreast on his desk, he would ask the writer, why this or that sentence might not have found as appropriate a place under this or that other thesis: and if no satisfying answer could be returned, and two faults of the same kind were found in one exercise, the irrevocable verdict followed, the exercise was torn up, and another on the same subject to be produced, in addition to the tasks of the day.  \\nHe later wrote of his loneliness at school in the poem Frost at Midnight:\\n\"With unclosed lids, already had I dreamt/Of my sweet birthplace.\"\\nFrom 1791 until 1794, Coleridge attended Jesus College, Cambridge. In 1792, he won the Browne Gold Medal for an ode that he wrote on the slave trade. In December 1793, he left the college and enlisted in the 15th (The King\\'s) Light Dragoons using the false name \"Silas Tomkyn Comberbache\", perhaps because of debt or because the girl that he loved, Mary Evans, had rejected him. His brothers arranged for his discharge a few months later under the reason of \"insanity\" and he was readmitted to Jesus College, though he would never receive a degree from the university.\\n\\n\\n== Pantisocracy and marriage ==\\n\\n\\n=== Cambridge and Somerset ===\\nAt Jesus College, Coleridge was introduced to political and theological ideas then considered radical, including those of the poet Robert Southey with whom he collaborated on the play The Fall of Robespierre. Coleridge joined Southey in a plan, later abandoned, to found a utopian commune-like society, called Pantisocracy, in the wilderness of Pennsylvania. In 1795, the two friends married sisters Sara and Edith Fricker, in St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, but Coleridge\\'s marriage with Sara proved unhappy. He grew to detest his wife, whom he married mainly because of social constraints. Following the birth of their fourth child, he eventually separated from her.\\nA third sister, Mary, had already married a third poet Robert Lovell and both became partners in Pantisocracy. Lovell also introduced Coleridge and Southey to their future patron Joseph Cottle but died of a fever in April 1796. Coleridge was with him at his death.\\nIn 1796 he released his first volume of poems entitled Poems on various subjects, which also included four poems by Charles Lamb as well as a collaboration with Robert Southey and a work suggested by his and Lamb\\'s schoolfriend Robert Favell. Among the poems were Religious Musings, Monody on the Death of Chatterton and an early version of The Eolian Harp entitled Effusion 35. A second edition was printed in 1797, this time including an appendix of works by Lamb and Charles Lloyd, a young poet to whom Coleridge had become a private tutor.\\nIn 1796 he also privately printed Sonnets from Various Authors, including sonnets by Lamb, Lloyd, Southey and himself as well as older poets such as William Lisle Bowles.\\nColeridge made plans to establish a journal, The Watchman, to be printed every eight days to avoid a weekly newspaper tax. The first issue of the short-lived journal was published in March 1796. It had ceased publication by May of that year.The years 1797 and 1798, during which he lived in what is now known as Coleridge Cottage, in Nether Stowey, Somerset, were among the most fruitful of Coleridge\\'s life. In 1795, Coleridge met poet William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy. (Wordsworth, having visited him and being enchanted by the surroundings, rented Alfoxton Park, a little over three miles [5 km] away.) Besides The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Coleridge composed the symbolic poem Kubla Khan, written—Coleridge himself claimed—as a result of an opium dream, in \"a kind of a reverie\"; and the first part of the narrative poem Christabel. The writing of Kubla Khan, written about the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan and his legendary palace at Xanadu, was said to have been interrupted by the arrival of a \"Person from Porlock\" – an event that has been embellished upon in such varied contexts as science fiction and Nabokov\\'s Lolita. During this period, he also produced his much-praised \"conversation poems\" This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison, Frost at Midnight, and The Nightingale.\\nIn 1798, Coleridge and Wordsworth published a joint volume of poetry, Lyrical Ballads, which proved to be the starting point for the English romantic age. Wordsworth may have contributed more poems, but the real star of the collection was Coleridge\\'s first version of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. It was the longest work and drew more praise and attention than anything else in the volume. In the spring Coleridge temporarily took over for Rev. Joshua Toulmin at Taunton\\'s Mary Street Unitarian Chapel while Rev. Toulmin grieved over the drowning death of his daughter Jane. Poetically commenting on Toulmin\\'s strength, Coleridge wrote in a 1798 letter to John Prior Estlin, \"I walked into Taunton (eleven miles) and back again, and performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin.  I suppose you must have heard that his daughter, (Jane, on 15 April 1798) in a melancholy derangement, suffered herself to be swallowed up by the tide on the sea-coast between Sidmouth and Bere  [sic] (Beer).  These events cut cruelly into the hearts of old men: but the good Dr. Toulmin bears it like the true practical Christian, – there is indeed a tear in his eye, but that eye is lifted up to the Heavenly Father.\"\\n\\n\\n=== The West Midlands and the North ===\\nColeridge also worked briefly in Shropshire, where he came in December 1797 as locum to its local Unitarian minister, Dr Rowe, in their church in the High Street at Shrewsbury.  He is said to have read his Rime of the Ancient Mariner at a literary evening in Mardol.  He was then contemplating a career in the ministry, and gave a probationary sermon in High Street church on Sunday, 14 January 1798. William Hazlitt, a Unitarian minister\\'s son, was in the congregation, having walked from Wem to hear him.  Coleridge later visited Hazlitt and his father at Wem but within a day or two of preaching he received a letter from Josiah Wedgwood II, who had offered to help him out of financial difficulties with an annuity of £150 (approximately £13,000 in today\\'s money) per year on condition he give up his ministerial career.  Coleridge accepted this, to the disappointment of Hazlitt who hoped to have him as a neighbour in Shropshire.From 16 September 1798, Coleridge and the Wordsworths left for a stay in Germany; Coleridge soon went his own way and spent much of his time in university towns. In February 1799 he enrolled at the University of Göttingen, where he attended lectures by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and Johann Gottfried Eichhorn. During this period, he became interested in German philosophy, especially the transcendental idealism and critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and in the literary criticism of the 18th-century dramatist Gotthold Lessing. Coleridge studied German and, after his return to England, translated the dramatic trilogy Wallenstein by the German Classical poet Friedrich Schiller into English. He continued to pioneer these ideas through his own critical writings for the rest of his life (sometimes without attribution), although they were unfamiliar and difficult for a culture dominated by empiricism.\\nIn 1799, Coleridge and the Wordsworths stayed at Thomas Hutchinson\\'s farm on the River Tees at Sockburn, near Darlington.\\n\\nIt was at Sockburn that Coleridge wrote his ballad-poem Love, addressed to Sara Hutchinson. The knight mentioned is the mailed figure on the Conyers tomb in ruined Sockburn church. The figure has a wyvern at his feet, a reference to the Sockburn Worm slain by Sir John Conyers (and a possible source for Lewis Carroll\\'s Jabberwocky). The worm was supposedly buried under the rock in the nearby pasture; this was the \\'greystone\\' of Coleridge\\'s first draft, later transformed into a \\'mount\\'. The poem was a direct inspiration for John Keats\\' famous poem La Belle Dame Sans Merci.Coleridge\\'s early intellectual debts, besides German idealists like Kant and critics like Lessing, were first to William Godwin\\'s Political Justice, especially during his Pantisocratic period, and to David Hartley\\'s Observations on Man, which is the source of the psychology which is found in Frost at Midnight. Hartley argued that one becomes aware of sensory events as impressions, and that \"ideas\" are derived by noticing similarities and differences between impressions and then by naming them. Connections resulting from the coincidence of impressions create linkages, so that the occurrence of one impression triggers those links and calls up the memory of those ideas with which it is associated (See Dorothy Emmet, \"Coleridge and Philosophy\").\\nColeridge was critical of the literary taste of his contemporaries, and a literary conservative insofar as he was afraid that the lack of taste in the ever growing masses of literate people would mean a continued desecration of literature itself.\\nIn 1800, he returned to England and shortly thereafter settled with his family and friends in Greta Hall at Keswick in the Lake District of Cumberland to be near Grasmere, where Wordsworth had moved. He was a houseguest of the Wordsworths\\' for eighteen months, but was a difficult houseguest, as his dependency on laudanum grew and his frequent nightmares would wake the children. He was also a fussy eater, to Dorothy Wordsworth\\'s frustration, who had to cook. For example, not content with salt, Coleridge sprinkled cayenne pepper on his eggs, which he ate from a teacup. His marital problems, nightmares, illnesses, increased opium dependency, tensions with Wordsworth, and a lack of confidence in his poetic powers fuelled the composition of Dejection: An Ode and an intensification of his philosophical studies.In 1802, Coleridge took a nine-day walking holiday in the fells of the Lake District. Coleridge is credited with the first recorded descent of Scafell to Mickledore via Broad Stand, although this was more due to his getting lost than a keenness for mountaineering.\\n\\n\\n== Later life and increasing drug use ==\\n\\n\\n=== Travel and The Friend ===\\nIn 1804, he travelled to Sicily and Malta, working for a time as Acting Public Secretary of Malta under the Civil Commissioner, Alexander Ball, a task he performed quite successfully. He lived in San Anton Palace in the village of Attard.  He gave this up and returned to England in 1806. Dorothy Wordsworth was shocked at his condition upon his return. From 1807 to 1808, Coleridge returned to Malta and then travelled in Sicily and Italy, in the hope that leaving Britain\\'s damp climate would improve his health and thus enable him to reduce his consumption of opium. Thomas De Quincey alleges in his Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets that it was during this period that Coleridge became a full-blown opium addict, using the drug as a substitute for the lost vigour and creativity of his youth.  It has been suggested that this reflects De Quincey\\'s own experiences more than Coleridge\\'s.His opium addiction (he was using as much as two quarts of laudanum a week) now began to take over his life: he separated from his wife Sara in 1808, quarrelled with Wordsworth in 1810, lost part of his annuity in 1811, and put himself under the care of Dr. Daniel in 1814. His addiction caused severe constipation, which required regular and humiliating enemas.In 1809, Coleridge made his second attempt to become a newspaper publisher with the publication of the journal entitled The Friend. It was a weekly publication that, in Coleridge\\'s typically ambitious style, was written, edited, and published almost entirely single-handedly. Given that Coleridge tended to be highly disorganised and had no head for business, the publication was probably doomed from the start. Coleridge financed the journal by selling over five hundred subscriptions, over two dozen of which were sold to members of Parliament, but in late 1809, publication was crippled by a financial crisis and Coleridge was obliged to approach \"Conversation Sharp\", Tom Poole and one or two other wealthy friends for an emergency loan to continue. The Friend was an eclectic publication that drew upon every corner of Coleridge\\'s remarkably diverse knowledge of law, philosophy, morals, politics, history, and literary criticism. Although it was often turgid, rambling, and inaccessible to most readers, it ran for 25 issues and was republished in book form a number of times. Years after its initial publication, The Friend became a highly influential work and its effect was felt on writers and philosophers from John Stuart Mill to Ralph Waldo Emerson.\\n\\n\\n=== London: final years and death ===\\n\\nBetween 1810 and 1820, Coleridge gave a series of lectures in London and Bristol – those on Shakespeare renewed interest in the playwright as a model for contemporary writers. Much of Coleridge\\'s reputation as a literary critic is founded on the lectures that he undertook in the winter of 1810–11, which were sponsored by the Philosophical Institution and given at Scot\\'s Corporation Hall off Fetter Lane, Fleet Street. These lectures were heralded in the prospectus as \"A Course of Lectures on Shakespeare and Milton, in Illustration of the Principles of Poetry.\" Coleridge\\'s ill-health, opium-addiction problems, and somewhat unstable personality meant that all his lectures were plagued with problems of delays and a general irregularity of quality from one lecture to the next. As a result of these factors, Coleridge often failed to prepare anything but the loosest set of notes for his lectures and regularly entered into extremely long digressions which his audiences found difficult to follow. However, it was the lecture on Hamlet given on 2 January 1812 that was considered the best and has influenced Hamlet studies ever since. Before Coleridge, Hamlet was often denigrated and belittled by critics from Voltaire to Dr. Johnson. Coleridge rescued the play\\'s reputation, and his thoughts on it are often still published as supplements to the text.\\nIn 1812 he allowed Robert Southey to make use of extracts from his vast number of private notebooks in their collaboration Omniana; Or, Horae Otiosiores.\\nIn August 1814, Coleridge was approached by Lord Byron\\'s publisher, John Murray, about the possibility of translating Goethe\\'s classic Faust (1808). Coleridge was regarded by many as the greatest living writer on the demonic and he accepted the commission, only to abandon work on it after six weeks. Until recently, scholars were in agreement that Coleridge never returned to the project, despite Goethe\\'s own belief in the 1820s that he had in fact completed a long translation of the work. In September 2007, Oxford University Press sparked a heated scholarly controversy by publishing an English translation of Goethe\\'s work that purported to be Coleridge\\'s long-lost masterpiece (the text in question first appeared anonymously in 1821).Between 1814 and 1816, Coleridge lived in Calne, Wiltshire and seemed able to focus on his work and manage his addiction, drafting Biographia Literaria. He rented rooms from a local surgeon, Mr Page, on Church Street, just opposite the entrance to the churchyard. A blue plaque marks the property today.In April 1816, Coleridge, with his addiction worsening, his spirits depressed, and his family alienated, took residence in the Highgate homes, then just north of London, of the physician James Gillman, first at South Grove and later at the nearby 3 The Grove. It is unclear whether his growing use of opium (and the brandy in which it was dissolved) was a symptom or a cause of his growing depression. Gillman was partially successful in controlling the poet\\'s addiction. Coleridge remained in Highgate for the rest of his life, and the house became a place of literary pilgrimage for writers including Carlyle and Emerson.\\nIn Gillman\\'s home, Coleridge finished his major prose work, the Biographia Literaria (mostly drafted in 1815, and finished in 1817), a volume composed of 23 chapters of autobiographical notes and dissertations on various subjects, including some incisive literary theory and criticism. He composed a considerable amount of poetry, of variable quality. He published other writings while he was living at the Gillman homes, notably the Lay Sermons of 1816 and 1817, Sibylline Leaves (1817), Hush (1820), Aids to Reflection (1825), and On the Constitution of the Church and State (1830). He also produced essays published shortly after his death, such as Essay on Faith (1838) and Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit (1840). A number of his followers were central to the Oxford Movement, and his religious writings profoundly shaped Anglicanism in the mid-nineteenth century.Coleridge also worked extensively on the various manuscripts which form his \"Opus Maximum\", a work which was in part intended as a post-Kantian work of philosophical synthesis.  The work was never published in his lifetime, and has frequently been seen as evidence for his tendency to conceive grand projects which he then had difficulty in carrying through to completion. But while he frequently berated himself for his \"indolence\", the long list of his published works calls this myth into question. Critics are divided on whether the \"Opus Maximum\", first published in 2002, successfully resolved the philosophical issues he had been exploring for most of his adult life.\\nColeridge died in Highgate, London on 25 July 1834 as a result of heart failure compounded by an unknown lung disorder, possibly linked to his use of opium. Coleridge had spent 18 years under the roof of the Gillman family, who built an addition onto their home to accommodate the poet.Faith may be defined as fidelity to our own being, so far as such being is not and cannot become an object of the senses; and hence, by clear inference or implication to being generally, as far as the same is not the object of the senses; and again to whatever is affirmed or understood as the condition, or concomitant, or consequence of the same. This will be best explained by an instance or example. That I am conscious of something within me peremptorily commanding me to do unto others as I would they should do unto me; in other words a categorical (that is, primary and unconditional) imperative; that the maxim (regula maxima, or supreme rule) of my actions, both inward and outward, should be such as I could, without any contradiction arising therefrom, will to be the law of all moral and rational beings. Essay on Faith\\nCarlyle described him at Highgate: \"Coleridge sat on the brow of Highgate Hill, in those years, looking down on London and its smoke-tumult, like a sage escaped from the inanity of life\\'s battle ... The practical intellects of the world did not much heed him, or carelessly reckoned him a metaphysical dreamer: but to the rising spirits of the young generation he had this dusky sublime character; and sat there as a kind of Magus, girt in mystery and enigma; his Dodona oak-grove (Mr. Gilman\\'s house at Highgate) whispering strange things, uncertain whether oracles or jargon.\"\\n\\n\\n== Remains ==\\nColeridge is buried in the aisle of St. Michael\\'s Parish Church in Highgate, London. He was originally buried at Old Highgate Chapel but was re-interred in St. Michael\\'s in 1961. Coleridge could see the red door of the then new church from his last residence across the green, where he lived with a doctor he had hoped might cure him (in a house owned today by Kate Moss). When it was discovered Coleridge\\'s vault had become derelict, the coffins – Coleridge\\'s and those of his wife, daughter, son-in-law, and grandson – were moved to St. Michael\\'s after an international fundraising appeal.Drew Clode, a member of St. Michael\\'s stewardship committee states, \"they put the coffins in a convenient space which was dry and secure, and quite suitable, bricked them up and forgot about them\". A recent excavation revealed the coffins were not in the location most believed, the far corner of the crypt, but actually below a memorial slab in the nave inscribed with: “Beneath this stone lies the body of Samuel Taylor Coleridge”.St. Michael\\'s plans to restore the crypt and allow public access. Says vicar Kunle Ayodeji of the plans: “. . we hope that the whole crypt can be cleared as a space for meetings and other uses, which would also allow access to Coleridge’s cellar.”\\n\\n\\n== Poetry ==\\nColeridge is one of the most important figures in English poetry. His poems directly and deeply influenced all the major poets of the age. He was known by his contemporaries as a meticulous craftsman who was more rigorous in his careful reworking of his poems than any other poet, and Southey and Wordsworth were dependent on his professional advice. His influence on Wordsworth is particularly important because many critics have credited Coleridge with the very idea of \"Conversational Poetry\". The idea of utilising common, everyday language to express profound poetic images and ideas for which Wordsworth became so famous may have originated almost entirely in Coleridge’s mind. It is difficult to imagine Wordsworth’s great poems, The Excursion or The Prelude, ever having been written without the direct influence of Coleridge’s originality.\\nAs important as Coleridge was to poetry as a poet, he was equally important to poetry as a critic. His philosophy of poetry, which he developed over many years, has been deeply influential in the field of literary criticism. This influence can be seen in such critics as A. O. Lovejoy and I. A. Richards.\\n\\n\\n=== The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Christabel, and Kubla Khan ===\\n\\nColeridge is arguably best known for his longer poems, particuarly The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Christabel. Even those who have never read the Rime have come under its influence: its words have given the English language the metaphor of an albatross around one\\'s neck, the quotation of \"water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink\" (almost always rendered as \"but not a drop to drink\"), and the phrase \"a sadder and a wiser man\" (usually rendered as \"a sadder but wiser man\"). The phrase \"All creatures great and small\" may have been inspired by The Rime: \"He prayeth best, who loveth best;/ All things both great and small;/ For the dear God who loveth us;/ He made and loveth all.\" Christabel is known for its musical rhythm, language, and its Gothic tale.\\nKubla Khan, or, A Vision in a Dream, A Fragment, although shorter, is also widely known. Both Kubla Khan and Christabel have an additional \"Romantic\" aura because they were never finished. Stopford Brooke characterised both poems as having no rival due to their \"exquisite metrical movement\" and \"imaginative phrasing.\"\\n\\n\\n=== The Conversation poems ===\\n\\nThe eight of Coleridge\\'s poems listed above are now often discussed as a group entitled \"Conversation poems\". The term itself was coined in 1928 by George McLean Harper, who borrowed the subtitle of The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem (1798) to describe the seven other poems as well. The poems are considered by many critics to be among Coleridge\\'s finest verses; thus Harold Bloom has written, \"With Dejection, The Ancient Mariner, and Kubla Khan, Frost at Midnight shows Coleridge at his most impressive.\" They are also among his most influential poems, as discussed further below.\\nHarper himself considered that the eight poems represented a form of blank verse that is \"...more fluent and easy than Milton\\'s, or any that had been written since Milton\". In 2006 Robert Koelzer wrote about another aspect of this apparent \"easiness\", noting that Conversation poems such as \"... Coleridge\\'s The Eolian Harp and The Nightingale maintain a middle register of speech, employing an idiomatic language that is capable of being construed as un-symbolic and un-musical: language that lets itself be taken as \\'merely talk\\' rather than rapturous \\'song\\'.\"\\n\\nThe last ten lines of Frost at Midnight were chosen by Harper as the \"best example of the peculiar kind of blank verse Coleridge had evolved, as natural-seeming as prose, but as exquisitely artistic as the most complicated sonnet.\" The speaker of the poem is addressing his infant son, asleep by his side:\\n\\nIn 1965, M. H. Abrams wrote a broad description that applies to the Conversation poems: \"The speaker begins with a description of the landscape; an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied by integral process of memory, thought, anticipation, and feeling which remains closely intervolved with the outer scene. In the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight, faces up to a tragic loss, comes to a moral decision, or resolves an emotional problem. Often the poem rounds itself to end where it began, at the outer scene, but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which is the result of the intervening meditation.\" In fact, Abrams was describing both the Conversation poems and later poems influenced by them. Abrams\\' essay has been called a \"touchstone of literary criticism\". As Paul Magnuson described it in 2002, \"Abrams credited Coleridge with originating what Abrams called the \\'greater Romantic lyric\\', a genre that began with Coleridge\\'s \\'Conversation\\' poems, and included Wordsworth\\'s Tintern Abbey, Shelley\\'s Stanzas Written in Dejection and Keats\\'s Ode to a Nightingale, and was a major influence on more modern lyrics by Matthew Arnold, Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and W. H. Auden.\"\\n\\n\\n== Literary criticism ==\\n\\n\\n=== Biographia Literaria ===\\nIn addition to his poetry, Coleridge also wrote influential pieces of literary criticism including Biographia Literaria, a collection of his thoughts and opinions on literature which he published in 1817. The work delivered both biographical explanations of the author\\'s life as well as his impressions on literature. The collection also contained an analysis of a broad range of philosophical principles of literature ranging from Aristotle to Immanuel Kant and Schelling and applied them to the poetry of peers such as William Wordsworth. Coleridge\\'s explanation of metaphysical principles were popular topics of discourse in academic communities throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and T.S. Eliot stated that he believed that Coleridge was \"perhaps the greatest of English critics, and in a sense the last.\" Eliot suggests that Coleridge displayed \"natural abilities\" far greater than his contemporaries, dissecting literature and applying philosophical principles of metaphysics in a way that brought the subject of his criticisms away from the text and into a world of logical analysis that mixed logical analysis and emotion. However, Eliot also criticises Coleridge for allowing his emotion to play a role in the metaphysical process, believing that critics should not have emotions that are not provoked by the work being studied. Hugh Kenner in Historical Fictions, discusses Norman Fruman\\'s Coleridge, the Damaged Archangel and suggests that the term \"criticism\" is too often applied to Biographia Literaria, which both he and Fruman describe as having failed to explain or help the reader understand works of art. To Kenner, Coleridge\\'s attempt to discuss complex philosophical concepts without describing the rational process behind them displays a lack of critical thinking that makes the volume more of a biography than a work of criticism.In Biographia Literaria and his poetry, symbols are not merely \"objective correlatives\" to Coleridge, but instruments for making the universe and personal experience intelligible and spiritually covalent. To Coleridge, the \"cinque spotted spider,\" making its way upstream \"by fits and starts,\" [Biographia Literaria] is not merely a comment on the intermittent nature of creativity, imagination, or spiritual progress, but the journey and destination of his life. The spider\\'s five legs represent the central problem that Coleridge lived to resolve, the conflict between Aristotelian logic and Christian philosophy. Two legs of the spider represent the \"me-not me\" of thesis and antithesis, the idea that a thing cannot be itself and its opposite simultaneously, the basis of the clockwork Newtonian world view that Coleridge rejected. The remaining three legs—exothesis, mesothesis and synthesis or the Holy trinity—represent the idea that things can diverge without being contradictory. Taken together, the five legs—with synthesis in the center, form the Holy Cross of Ramist logic. The cinque-spotted spider is Coleridge\\'s emblem of holism, the quest and substance of Coleridge\\'s thought and spiritual life.\\n\\n\\n=== Coleridge and the influence of the Gothic ===\\n\\nColeridge wrote reviews of Ann Radcliffe\\'s books and The Mad Monk, among others. He comments in his reviews: \"Situations of torment, and images of naked horror, are easily conceived; and a writer in whose works they abound, deserves our gratitude almost equally with him who should drag us by way of sport through a military hospital, or force us to sit at the dissecting-table of a natural philosopher. To trace the nice boundaries, beyond which terror and sympathy are deserted by the pleasurable emotions, – to reach those limits, yet never to pass them, hic labor, hic opus est.\" and \"The horrible and the preternatural have usually seized on the popular taste, at the rise and decline of literature.  Most powerful stimulants, they can never be required except by the torpor of an unawakened, or the languor of an exhausted, appetite...  We trust, however, that satiety will banish what good sense should have prevented; and that, wearied with fiends, incomprehensible characters, with shrieks, murders, and subterraneous dungeons, the public will learn, by the multitude of the manufacturers, with how little expense of thought or imagination this species of composition is manufactured.\"\\nHowever, Coleridge used these elements in poems such as The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798), Christabel and Kubla Khan (published in 1816, but known in manuscript form before then) and certainly influenced other poets and writers of the time. Poems like these both drew inspiration from and helped to inflame the craze for Gothic romance. Coleridge also made considerable use of Gothic elements in his commercially successful play Remorse.Mary Shelley, who knew Coleridge well, mentions The Rime of the Ancient Mariner twice directly in Frankenstein, and some of the descriptions in the novel echo it indirectly. Although William Godwin, her father, disagreed with Coleridge on some important issues, he respected his opinions and Coleridge often visited the Godwins. Mary Shelley later recalled hiding behind the sofa and hearing his voice chanting The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\nC. S. Lewis also makes mention of his name in The Screwtape Letters (as a poor example of prayer, in which the devils should encourage).\\n\\n\\n== Religious beliefs ==\\nAlthough his father was an Anglican vicar, Coleridge worked as a Unitarian preacher between 1796 and 1797. He eventually returned to the Church of England in 1814. His most noteworthy writings on religion are Lay Sermons (1817), Aids to Reflection (1825) and The Constitution of Church and State (1830).\\n\\n\\n=== Theological legacy ===\\nDespite being mostly remembered today for his poetry and literary criticism, Coleridge was also (perhaps in his own eyes primarily) a theologian. His writings include discussions of the status of scripture, the doctrines of the Fall, justification and sanctification, and the personality and infinity of God. A key figure in the Anglican theology of his day, his writings are still regularly referred to by contemporary Anglican theologians. F. D. Maurice, F. J. A. Hort, F. W. Robertson, B. F. Westcott, John Oman and Thomas Erskine (once called the \"Scottish Coleridge\") were all influenced by him.\\n\\n\\n== Political thinking ==\\nColeridge was also a profound political thinker.  While he began his life as a political radical, and an enthusiast for the French Revolution; over the years Coleridge developed a more conservative view of society, somewhat in the manner of Burke. Although seen as cowardly treachery by the next generation of Romantic poets, Coleridge\\'s later thought became a fruitful source for the evolving radicalism of J. S. Mill. Mill found three aspects of Coleridge\\'s thought especially illuminating:\\n\\nFirst, there was Coleridge\\'s insistence on what he called \"the Idea\" behind an institution – its social function, in later terminology – as opposed to the possible flaws in its actual implementation. Coleridge sought to understand meaning from within a social matrix, not outside it, using an imaginative reconstruction of the past (Verstehen) or of unfamiliar systems.\\nSecondly, Coleridge explored the necessary conditions for social stability – what he termed Permanence, in counterbalance to Progress, in a polity – stressing the importance of a shared public sense of community, and national education.\\nColeridge also usefully employed the organic metaphor of natural growth to shed light on the historical development of British history, as exemplified in the common law tradition – working his way thereby towards a sociology of jurisprudence.\\n\\n\\n== Collected works ==\\nThe current standard edition is The Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, edited by Kathleen Coburn and many others from 1969 to 2002. This collection appeared across 16 volumes as Bollingen Series 75, published variously by Princeton University Press and Routledge & Kegan Paul.

       "'Zadie Adeline Smith FRSL (born 25 October 1975) is an English novelist, essayist, and short-story writer. Her debut novel, White Teeth (2000), immediately became a best-seller and won a number of awards. She has been a tenured professor in the Creative Writing faculty of New York University since September 2010.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nSmith was born in Willesden in the north-west London borough of Brent to a Jamaican mother, Yvonne Bailey, and an English father, Harvey Smith, who was 30 years his wife\\'s senior. At the age of 14, she changed her name from Sadie to Zadie.Smith\\'s mother grew up in Jamaica and emigrated to England in 1969. Smith\\'s parents divorced when she was a teenager. She has a half-sister, a half-brother, and two younger brothers (one is the rapper and stand-up comedian Doc Brown, and the other is the rapper Luc Skyz). As a child, Smith was fond of tap dancing, and in her teenage years, she considered a career in musical theatre. While at university, Smith earned money as a jazz singer, and wanted to become a journalist. Despite earlier ambitions, literature emerged as her principal interest.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nSmith attended the local state schools, Malorees Junior School and Hampstead Comprehensive School, and King\\'s College, Cambridge, where she studied English literature. In an interview with The Guardian in 2000, Smith corrected a newspaper assertion that she left Cambridge with a double First. \"Actually, I got a Third in my Part Ones\", she said. She graduated with upper second-class honours.Smith seems to have been rejected for a place in the Cambridge Footlights by the popular British comedy double act Mitchell and Webb, while all three were studying at Cambridge University in the 1990s.At Cambridge, Smith published a number of short stories in a collection of new student writing called The Mays Anthology. They attracted the attention of a publisher, who offered her a contract for her first novel. Smith decided to contact a literary agent and was taken on by A. P. Watt. Smith returned to guest-edit the anthology in 2001.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nSmith\\'s début novel White Teeth was introduced to the publishing world in 1997, before it was completed. On the basis of a partial manuscript, an auction for the rights was begun; Hamish Hamilton won. Smith completed White Teeth during her final year at Cambridge. Published in 2000, the novel immediately became a best-seller. It was praised internationally and won a number of awards, among them the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and the Betty Trask Award. The novel was adapted for television in 2002. Smith served as writer-in-residence at the ICA in London and subsequently published, as editor, an anthology of sex writing, Piece of Flesh, as the culmination of this role.\\nIn interviews, Smith reported that the hype surrounding her first novel had caused her to suffer briefly from writer\\'s block. Nevertheless, her second novel, The Autograph Man, was published in 2002 and was a commercial success, although it was not as well received by critics as White Teeth.\\nAfter the publication of The Autograph Man, Smith visited the United States as a Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. She started work on a still-unreleased book of essays, The Morality of the Novel (a.k.a. Fail Better), in which she considers a selection of 20th-century writers through the lens of moral philosophy. Some portions of this book presumably appear in the essay collection Changing My Mind, published in November 2009.Smith\\'s third novel, On Beauty, was published in September 2005. It is set largely in and around Greater Boston. It attracted more acclaim than The Autograph Man: it was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and won the 2006 Orange Prize for Fiction and the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.Later in the same year, Smith published Martha and Hanwell, a book that pairs two short stories about two troubled characters, originally published in Granta and The New Yorker respectively. Penguin published Martha and Hanwell with a new introduction by the author as part of their pocket series to celebrate their 70th birthday. The first story, \"Martha, Martha\", deals with Smith\\'s familiar themes of race and postcolonial identity, while \"Hanwell in Hell\" is about a man struggling to cope with the death of his wife. In December 2008 she guest-edited the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.After teaching fiction at Columbia University School of the Arts, Smith joined New York University as a tenured professor of fiction in 2010.Smith\\'s novel NW was published in 2012. It is set in the Kilburn area of north-west London, the title being a reference to the local postcode, NW6. NW was shortlisted for the Royal Society of Literature\\'s Ondaatje Prize and the Women\\'s Prize for Fiction. NW was made into a BBC television film directed by Saul Dibb and adapted by Rachel Bennette. Starring Nikki Amuka-Bird and Phoebe Fox, it was broadcast on BBC Two on 14 November 2016.In 2015 it was announced that Smith, along with her husband Nick Laird, was writing the screenplay for a science fiction movie to be directed by French filmmaker Claire Denis. Smith later said that her involvement had been overstated and that she had simply helped to polish the English dialogue for the film.Smith\\'s fifth novel, Swing Time, was published in November 2016. It was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize 2017.\\nBetween March and October 2011, Smith was the monthly New Books reviewer for Harper\\'s Magazine. She is also a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books. In 2010, The Guardian newspaper asked Smith for her \"10 rules for writing fiction\". Among them she declared: \"Tell the truth through whichever veil comes to hand – but tell it. Resign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never being satisfied.\"Smith\\'s first collection of short stories, Grand Union, was published on October 8th, 2019.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nSmith met Nick Laird at Cambridge University. They married in 2004 in the Chapel of King\\'s College, Cambridge. Smith dedicated On Beauty to \"my dear Laird\". She also uses his name in passing in White Teeth: \"An\\' all the good-lookin\\' men, all the rides like your man Nicky Laird, they\\'re all dead.\"The couple lived in Rome, Italy, from November 2006 to 2007, and are now based in New York City and Queen\\'s Park, London. They have two children, Katherine (Kit) and Harvey (Hal).Smith describes herself as \"unreligious\", and was not raised in a religion, although retains a \"curiosity\" about the role religion plays in others\\' lives. In an essay exploring humanist and existentialist views of death and dying, Smith characterises her worldview as that of a \"sentimental humanist\".\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Novels ===\\nWhite Teeth (2000)\\nThe Autograph Man (2002)\\nOn Beauty (2005)\\nNW (2012)\\nSwing Time (2016)\\n\\n\\n=== Plays ===\\nThe Wife of Willesden (announced in 2019)\\n\\n\\n=== Short fiction ===\\nCollections\"Martha and Hanwell\" (2005)\\nGrand Union: Stories (2019)Stories\\n\\n\\n=== Non-fiction ===\\nChanging My Mind: Occasional Essays (2009)\\nStop What You\\'re Doing and Read This!

       "'anna laetitia barbauld    by herself possibly   as in french  née aikin   june  –  march   was a prominent english poet  essayist  literary critic  editor  and author of children s literature \\na  woman of letters  who published in multiple genres  barbauld had a successful writing career at a time when women rarely wrote professionally  she was a noted teacher at the palgrave academy and an innovative writer of works for children  her primers provided a model for more than a century  her essays showed it was possible for a woman to be publicly engaged in politics  other women authors such as elizabeth benger emulated her  barbauld s literary career spanned numerous periods in british literary history  her work promoted the values of the enlightenment and of sensibility  while her poetry made a founding contribution to the development of british romanticism  barbauld was also a literary critic  her anthology of  century novels helped to establish the canon as it is known today \\nbarbauld s career as a poet ended abruptly in   with the publication of eighteen hundred and eleven  which criticised britain s participation in the napoleonic wars  she was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime  her reputation was further damaged when many of the romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the french revolution turned against her in their later  more conservative years  barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children s writer in the  century  and largely forgotten in the   until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the  renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history \\n\\n\\n \\nmuch of what is known about barbauld s life comes from two memoirs  the first published in  and written by her niece  lucy aikin  and the second published in   written by her great niece anna letitia le breton  some letters from barbauld to others also exist  however  a great many barbauld family documents were lost in a fire that resulted from the london blitz in  \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nbarbauld was born on  june  at kibworth harcourt in leicestershire to jane and john aikin  she was named after her maternal grandmother and referred to as  nancy   a nickname for anna   she was baptised by her mother s brother  john jennings  in huntingdonshire two weeks after her birth  barbauld s father was headmaster of the dissenting academy in kibworth harcourt and minister at a nearby presbyterian church  she spent her childhood in what barbauld scholar william mccarthy describes as  one of the best houses in kibworth and in the very middle of the village square   she was much in the public eye  as the house was also a boys  school  the family had a comfortable standard of living  mccarthy suggests they may have ranked with large freeholders  well to do tradesmen  and manufacturers  at barbauld s father s death in   his estate was valued at more than £  barbauld commented to her husband in    for the early part of my life i conversed little with my own sex  in the village where i was  there was none to converse with   barbauld was surrounded by boys as a child and adopted their high spirits  her mother attempted to subdue these  which would have been viewed as unseemly in a woman  according to lucy aikin s memoir  what resulted was  a double portion of bashfulness and maidenly reserve  in barbauld s character  barbauld was uncomfortable with her identity as a woman and believed she had failed to live up to the ideal of womanhood  much of her writing would focus on issues central to women  and her outsider perspective allowed her to question many of the traditional assumptions about femininity being made in the  century barbauld demanded that her father teach her the classics and after much pestering  he did  she had the opportunity to learn not only latin and greek  but french  italian  and many other subjects generally deemed unnecessary for women at the time  barbauld s penchant for study worried her mother  who expected her to end up a spinster because of her intellectualism  the two were never so close as barbauld and her father  yet barbauld s mother was proud of her accomplishments and in later years wrote of her daughter   i once indeed knew a little girl who was as eager to learn as her instructors could be to teach her  and who at two years old could read sentences and little stories in her wise book  roundly  without spelling  and in half a year more could read as well as most women  but i never knew such another  and i believe never shall  barbauld s brother  john aikin  described their father as  the best parent  the wisest counsellor  the most affectionate friend  every thing that could command love and veneration   barbauld s father prompted many such tributes  although lucy aikin described him as excessively modest and reserved  barbauld developed a strong bond with her only sibling during childhood  standing in as a mother figure to him  they eventually became literary partners  in   joanna baillie commented of their relationship   how few brothers and sisters have been to one another what they have been through so long a course of years  \\n\\nin   the family moved to warrington academy  halfway between the growing industrial cities of liverpool and manchester  where barbauld s father had been offered a teaching position  some of the founders of the academy were members of octagon chapel  whose creedless and liberal  liverpool liturgy  formed a starting point for her beliefs and writings  the academy drew many luminaries of the day  such as the natural philosopher and unitarian theologian joseph priestley  and came to be known as  the athens of the north  for its stimulating intellectual atmosphere  another instructor may have been the french revolutionary jean paul marat  school records suggest he taught french there in the   he may also have been a suitor to barbauld – he allegedly wrote to john aikin declaring his intention to become an english citizen and marry her  archibald hamilton rowan also fell in love with barbauld  describing her later as  possessed of great beauty  distinct traces of which she retained to the latest of her life  her person was slender  her complexion exquisitely fair with the bloom of perfect health  her features regular and elegant  and her dark blue eyes beamed with the light of wit and fancy   despite her mother s anxiety  barbauld received many offers of marriage around this time – all of which she declined \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nin   barbauld brought out her first book of poems  after her friends had praised them and convinced her to publish them  the collection  entitled simply poems  went through four editions in a single year and surprised barbauld by its success  barbauld became a respected literary figure in england on the reputation of poems alone  in the same year  she and her brother  john aikin  jointly published miscellaneous pieces in prose  which was also well received  the essays in it  most of which were by barbauld  were favourably compared to those of samuel johnson in may   despite some  misgivings   barbauld married rochemont barbauld  –   the grandson of a french huguenot and a former pupil at warrington  according to barbauld s niece  lucy aikin \\n\\n h er attachment to mr  barbauld was the illusion of a romantic fancy – not of a tender heart  had her true affections been early called forth by a more genial home atmosphere  she would never have allowed herself to be caught by crazy demonstrations of amorous rapture  set off with theatrical french manners  or have conceived of such exaggerated passion as a safe foundation on which to raise the sober structure of domestic happiness  my father ascribed that ill starred union in great part to the baleful influence of  jean jacques rousseau s   nouvelle heloise   mr  b  impersonating st  preux   barbauld  was informed by a true friend that he had experienced one attack of insanity  and was urged to break off the engagement on that account  –  then   answered she   if i were now to disappoint him  he would certainly go mad   to this there could be no reply  and with a kind of desperate generosity she rushed upon her melancholy destiny \\nafter the wedding  the couple moved to suffolk  near where rochemont had been offered a congregation and a school for boys  barbauld took this time and rewrote some of the psalms  a common pastime in the  century  publishing them as devotional pieces compiled from the psalms and the book of job  attached to this work is her essay  thoughts on the devotional taste  on sects and on establishments   which explains her theory of religious feeling and the problems inherent in institutionalising religion \\n\\nit seems that barbauld and her husband were concerned that they would never have a child of their own  and in   after only a year of marriage  barbauld suggested to her brother that they adopt one of his children i am sensible it is not a small thing we ask  nor can it be easy for a parent to part with a child  this i would say  from a number  one may more easily be spared  though it makes a very material difference in happiness whether a person has children or no children  it makes  i apprehend  little or none whether he has three  or four  five  or six  because four or five are enow to exercise all his whole stock of care and affection  we should gain  but you would not lose \\nafter a time  her brother conceded and the couple adopted charles  it was for him that barbauld wrote her most famous books  lessons for children  –  and hymns in prose for children    \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nbarbauld and her husband spent eleven years teaching at palgrave academy in suffolk  early on  barbauld was responsible not only for running her own household  but also the school s  to which she served as accountant  maid  and housekeeper  the school opened with only eight boys  but the number had risen to about forty by the time the barbaulds left in   which reflects the excellent reputation the school had acquired  the barbaulds  educational philosophy attracted dissenters as well as anglicans  palgrave replaced the strict discipline of traditional schools such as eton  which often used corporal punishment  with a system of  fines and jobations  and even  it seems likely   juvenile trials   that is  trials run by and for the students themselves  moreover  instead of the traditional classical studies  the school offered a practical curriculum that stressed science and the modern languages  barbauld herself taught the foundation subjects of reading and religion to the youngest boys  and geography  history  composition  rhetoric and science to higher grade levels  she was a dedicated teacher  producing a  weekly chronicle  for the school and writing theatrical pieces for the students to perform  barbauld had a profound effect on many of her students  one who went on to great success was william taylor  a pre eminent scholar of german literature  who referred to barbauld as  the mother of his mind  \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nin september   the barbaulds left palgrave for a tour of france  by this time rochemont s mental health was deteriorating and he was no longer able to carry out his teaching duties  in   they moved to hampstead  where rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became rosslyn hill unitarian chapel  it was here that barbauld became close friends with joanna baillie  the playwright  although no longer in charge of a school  the barbaulds did not abandon their commitment to education  they often boarded one or two pupils recommended by personal friends during this time  the heyday of the french revolution  barbauld published her most radical political pieces  from  to   charles james fox attempted to convince the house of commons to pass a law granting dissenters full citizenship rights  when this bill was defeated for the third time  barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets  an address to the opposers of the repeal of the corporation and test acts  see test act   readers were shocked to discover that such a well reasoned argument should come from a woman  in   after william wilberforce s attempt to outlaw the slave trade had failed  barbauld published her epistle to william wilberforce esq  on the rejection of the bill for abolishing the slave trade  which not only lamented the fate of the slaves  but warned of the cultural and social degeneration the british could expect if they did not abandon slavery  in   she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti war sermon entitled sins of government  sins of the nation which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation   we are called upon to repent of national sins  because we can help them  and because we ought to help them  \\n\\n\\n \\nin   the barbaulds moved to stoke newington  where rochemont took over the pastoral duties of the unitarian chapel at newington green  barbauld herself was happy to be nearer her brother  john  as her husband s mind was rapidly failing  rochemont developed a  violent antipathy to his wife and he was liable to fits of insane fury directed against her  one day at dinner he seized a knife and chased her round the table so that she only saved herself by jumping out of the window   such scenes repeated themselves to barbauld s great sadness and real danger  but she refused to leave him  rochemont drowned himself in the nearby new river in  and barbauld was overcome with grief  when she returned to writing  she produced the radical poem eighteen hundred and eleven     which depicted england as a ruin  it was reviewed so viciously that barbauld never published another work in her lifetime  although it is now often viewed by scholars as her greatest poetic achievement  she died in   a renowned writer  and was buried in the family vault in st mary s  stoke newington  after her death  a marble tablet was erected in the newington green chapel with the following inscription \\n\\n\\n \\n \\nat her death  barbauld was lauded in the newcastle magazine as  unquestionably the first  i e   best  of our female poets  and one of the most eloquent and powerful of our prose writers  and the imperial magazine declared  so long as letters shall be cultivated in britain  or wherever the english language shall be known  so long will the name of this lady be respected   she was favourably compared to both joseph addison and samuel johnson – no mean feat for a woman writer in the  century  by   however  she was remembered only as a moralising writer for children  if that  it was not until the advent of feminist literary criticism in the academic world of the  and  that barbauld finally began to be included in literary history \\nbarbauld s remarkable disappearance from the literary landscape took place for a number of reasons  one of the most important was the disdain heaped upon her by samuel taylor coleridge and william wordsworth  poets who in their youthful  radical days had looked to her poetry for inspiration  but in their later  conservative years dismissed her work  once these poets had become canonised  their opinions held sway  moreover  the intellectual ferment of which barbauld was an important part of – particularly at the dissenting academies – had by the end of the  century come to be associated with the  philistine  middle class  as matthew arnold put it  the reformist  century middle class was later held responsible for the excesses and abuses of the industrial age  finally  the victorians viewed barbauld as  an icon of sentimental saintliness  and  erased her political courage  her tough mindedness   and  her talent for humor and irony   to arrive at a literary figure that modernists despised as literary studies developed into a discipline at the end of the  century  the story of the origins of romanticism in england emerged along with it  according to this version of literary history  coleridge and wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age  this view held sway for almost a century  even with the advent of feminist criticism in the   barbauld did not receive her due  as margaret ezell explains  feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman – one who was angry  who resisted the gender roles of her time  and who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women  barbauld did not easily fit into these categories  indeed  it was not until romanticism and its canon began to be re examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice that barbauld had contributed \\nbarbauld s works fell out of print and no full length scholarly biography of her was written until william mccarthy s anna letitia barbauld  voice of the enlightenment in  barbauld s adopted son charles grew up to be a doctor and chemist  he married a daughter of gilbert wakefield  their child  anna letitia le breton  wrote literary memoirs  which included a memoir of mrs  barbauld  including letters and notices of her family and friends in  \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nbarbauld s wide ranging poetry has been read primarily by feminist literary critics interested in recovering women writers important in their own time  but forgotten in literary history  isobel armstrong s work represents one way to do such a study  she argues that barbauld  like other romantic women poets \\n\\n    neither consented to the idea of a special feminine discourse nor accepted an account of themselves as belonging to the realm of the nonrational  they engaged with two strategies to deal with the problem of affective discourse  first  they used the customary  feminine  forms and languages  but they turned them to analytical account and used them to think with  second  they challenged the male philosophical traditions that led to a demeaning discourse of feminine experience and remade those traditions \\nin her subsequent analysis of  inscription for an ice house  armstrong points to barbauld s challenge of edmund burke s characterisation of the sublime and the beautiful and adam smith s economic theories in the wealth of nations as evidence for this interpretation \\n\\nthe work of marlon ross and anne k  mellor represents a second way to apply the insights of feminist theory to the recovery of women writers  they argue that barbauld and other romantic women poets carved out a distinctive feminine voice in the literary sphere  as a woman and a dissenter  barbauld had a unique perspective on society  according to ross  and it was this specific position that obliged her to publish social commentary  ross points out  however  that women were in a double bind   they could choose to speak politics in nonpolitical modes  and thus risk greatly diminishing the clarity and pointedness of their political passion  or they could choose literary modes that were overtly political while trying to infuse them with a recognizable  feminine  decorum  again risking a softening of their political agenda   so barbauld and other romantic women poets often wrote  occasional poems   these had traditionally commented  often satirically  on national events  but by the end of the  century were increasingly serious and personal  women wrote sentimental poems  a style then much in vogue  on personal occasions such as the birth of a child and argued that in commenting on the small occurrences of daily life  they would establish a moral foundation for the nation  scholars such as ross and mellor maintain that this adaptation of existing styles and genres is one way in which women poets created a feminine romanticism \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nbarbauld s most significant political texts are  an address to the opposers of the repeal of the corporation and test acts     epistle to william wilberforce on the rejection of the bill for abolishing the slave trade     sins of government  sins of the nation     and eighteen hundred and eleven     as harriet guest explains   the theme barbauld s essays of the  repeatedly return to is that of the constitution of the public as a religious  civic  and national body  and she is always concerned to emphasize the continuity between the rights of private individuals and those of the public defined in capaciously inclusive terms  for three years  from  to   dissenters had been attempting to convince parliament to repeal the test and corporation acts  which limited the civil rights of dissenters  after the repeal was voted down for the third time  barbauld burst onto the public stage after  nine years of silence   her highly charged pamphlet is written in a biting and sarcastic tone  it opens   we thank you for the compliment paid the dissenters  when you suppose that the moment they are eligible to places of power and profit  all such places will at once be filled with them   she argues that dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men   we claim it as men  we claim it as citizens  we claim it as good subjects   moreover  she contends that it is precisely the isolation forced on dissenters by others that marks them out  not anything inherent in their form of worship  finally  appealing to british patriotism  she maintains that the french cannot be allowed to outstrip the english in extending liberty in the following year  after one of william wilberforce s many efforts to suppress the slave trade failed to pass parliament  barbauld wrote her epistle to william wilberforce on the rejection of the bill for abolishing the slave trade     in it  she calls britain to account for the sin of slavery  she condemns in harsh tones the  avarice  of a country content to allow its wealth and prosperity to be supported by the labour of enslaved human beings  moreover  she draws a picture of the plantation mistress and master that reveals all of the failings of the  colonial enterprise   an  indolent  voluptuous  monstrous woman  and a  degenerate  enfeebled man  in   when the british government called on the nation to fast in honour of the war  anti war dissenters such as barbauld were left with a moral quandary   obey the order and violate their consciences by praying for success in a war they disapproved  observe the fast  but preach against the war  defy the proclamation and refuse to take any part in the fast   barbauld took this opportunity to write a sermon  sins of government  sins of the nation  on the moral responsibility of the individual  for her  each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation because he or she constitutes part of the nation  the essay attempts to determine what the proper role of the individual is in the state  and while she argues that  insubordination  can undermine a government  she admits there are lines of  conscience  that cannot be crossed in obeying a government  the text has been seen as a classic consideration of the idea of an  unjust war  \\nin eighteen hundred and eleven     written after britain had been at war with france for a decade and was on the brink of losing the napoleonic wars  barbauld presented a shocking juvenalian satire  she argued that the british empire was waning and the american empire waxing  it is to america that britain s wealth and fame will now go  she contended  and britain will become a mere empty ruin  she tied this decline directly to britain s participation in the napoleonic wars \\n\\nnot surprisingly  this pessimistic view of the future was poorly received   reviews  whether in liberal or conservative magazines  ranged from cautious to patronizingly negative to outrageously abusive   barbauld  stunned by the reaction  retreated from the public eye  even when britain was on the verge of winning the war  barbauld could not be joyous  she wrote to a friend   i do not know how to rejoice at this victory  splendid as it is  over buonaparte  when i consider the horrible waste of life  the mass of misery  which such gigantic combats must occasion  \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nbarbauld s lessons for children and hymns in prose for children made a revolution in children s literature  for the first time  the needs of the child reader were seriously considered  barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins so that children could easily read them  and even more importantly  she developed a style of  informal dialogue between parent and child  that would dominate children s literature for a generation  in lessons for children  a four volume  age adapted reading primer  barbauld employs the concept of a mother teaching her son  it is more than likely that many of the events in these stories were inspired by barbauld s experience of teaching her own son  charles  the series is far more than a way to acquire literacy – it also introduces the reader to  elements of society s symbol systems and conceptual structures  inculcates an ethics  and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility   moreover  it exposes the child to the principles of  botany  zoology  numbers  change of state in chemistry    the money system  the calendar  geography  meteorology  agriculture  political economy  geology   and  astronomy   the series was relatively popular  maria edgeworth commented in the educational treatise that she co authored with her father  practical education     it is  one of the best books for young people from seven to ten years old  that has yet appeared  some at the time saw barbauld s work as marking a shift in children s literature from fantasy to didacticism  sarah burney  in her popular novel traits of nature     has the  year old christina cleveland remark   well  then  you know fairy tales are forbidden pleasures in all modern school rooms  mrs  barbauld  and mrs  trimmer  and miss edgeworth  and a hundred others  have written good books for children  which have thrown poor mother goose  and the arabian nights  quite out of favour  – at least  with papas and mamas   a more strident criticism was made by the lambs  telling of mary s abortive search for a copy of goody two shoes  which her brother claimed was because  mrs  barbauld s stuff has banished all the old classics of the nursery  lessons for children and hymns in prose had  for children s books  an unprecedented impact  not only did they influence the poetry of william blake  william wordsworth  and jane taylor  they were also used to teach several generations of schoolchildren  children s literature scholar william mccarthy states   elizabeth barrett browning could still quote the opening lines of lessons for children at age thirty nine   although both samuel johnson and charles james fox ridiculed barbauld s children s books and believed that she was wasting her talents  barbauld herself saw such writing as noble and encouraged others to follow her  as betsy rodgers  her biographer explains   she gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature  and by not lowering her standard of writing for children  she inspired others to write on a similar high standard   in fact  because of barbauld  sarah trimmer and hannah more were inspired to write for poor children as well as organise a large scale sunday school movement  ellenor fenn to write and design a series of readers and games for middle class children  and richard lovell edgeworth to begin one of the first systematic studies of childhood development  which would culminate in an educational treatise authored by maria edgeworth and him  and in a large body of children s stories by maria \\n\\nbarbauld also collaborated with her brother john aikin on the six volume series evenings at home     it is a miscellany of stories  fables  dramas  poems  and dialogues  in many ways this series encapsulates the ideals of an enlightenment education   curiosity  observation  and reasoning   for example  the stories encourage the learning of science through hands on activities  in  a tea lecture  the child learns that tea making is  properly an operation of chemistry  and lessons on evaporation  and condensation follow  the text also emphasises rationality  in  things by their right names   a child demands that his father tell him a story about  a bloody murder   the father does so  using some of the fictional tropes of fairy tales such as  once upon a time   but confounding his son with details  such as the murderers all  had steel caps on   in the end the child realises his father has told him the story of a battle  and his father comments  i do not know of any murders half so bloody   both the tactic of defamiliarising the world to force the reader to think about it rationally  along with the anti war message of this tale  prevail throughout evenings at home  in fact  michelle levy  a scholar of the period  argued that the series encouraged readers to  become critical observers of and  where necessary  vocal resisters to authority   this resistance is learned and practised in the home  according to levy   evenings at home    makes the claim that social and political reform must begin in the family   it is families that are responsible for the nation s progress or regression \\naccording to lucy aikin  barbauld s niece  barbauld s contributions to evenings at home consisted of the following pieces   the young mouse    the wasp and bee    alfred  a drama    animals and countries    canute s reproof    the masque of nature    things by their right names    the goose and horse    on manufactures    the flying

end of her life  all of which helped to shape the canon as known today  first  in   she edited samuel richardson s correspondence and wrote an extensive biographical introduction of the man who was perhaps the most influential novelist of the  century  her   page essay on his life and works  was  the first substantial richardson biography   the following year she edited selections from the spectator  tatler  guardian  and freeholder  with a preliminary essay  a volume of essays emphasising  wit    manners  and  taste   in   she assembled the female speaker  an anthology of literature chosen specifically for young girls  because  according to barbauld s philosophy  what one reads when one is young is formative  she carefully considered the  delicacy  of her female readers and  direct ed  her choice to subjects more particularly appropriate to the duties  the employments  and the dispositions of the softer sex   the anthology is subdivided into sections such as  moral and didactic pieces  and  descriptive and pathetic pieces   it includes poetry and prose by  among others  alexander pope  hannah more  maria edgeworth  samuel johnson  james thomson and hester chapone \\nbarbauld s  volume series of the british novelists  published in  with a broad introductory essay on the history of the novel  allowed her to place her mark on literary history  it was  the first english edition to make comprehensive critical and historical claims  and was in every respect  a canon making enterprise   in an insightful essay  barbauld legitimises the novel  then still a controversial genre  by connecting it to ancient persian and greek literature  for her  a good novel is  an epic in prose  with more of character and less  indeed in modern novels nothing  of the supernatural machinery   barbauld maintains that novel reading has a multiplicity of benefits  not only is it a  domestic pleasure   but it is also a way to  infus e  principles and moral feelings  into the population  barbauld also provided introductions to each of the fifty authors included in the series \\n\\n\\n \\nunless otherwise noted  this list is taken from wolicky s entry on barbauld

professor of poetry  he withdrew his candidacy after reports of the accusations against him of sexual harassment from  and  when the media learned that pages from an american book on the topic were sent anonymously to a number of oxford academics  this aroused their interest in the university decisions ruth padel  also a leading candidate  was elected to the post  within days  the daily telegraph reported that she had alerted journalists to the harassment cases  under severe media and academic pressure  padel resigned  padel was the first woman to be elected to the oxford post  and some journalists attributed the criticism of her to misogyny and a gender war at oxford  they said that a male poet would not have been so criticized  as she had reported published information  not rumour numerous respected poets  including seamus heaney and al alvarez  published a letter of support for walcott in the times literary supplement  and criticized the press furore  other commentators suggested that both poets were casualties of the media interest in an internal university affair  because the story  had everything  from sex claims to allegations of character assassination   simon armitage and other poets expressed regret at padel s resignation \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\nmethodism and spirituality have played a significant role from the beginning in walcott s work  he commented   i have never separated the writing of poetry from prayer  i have grown up believing it is a vocation  a religious vocation   describing his writing process  he wrote   the body feels it is melting into what it has seen… the  i  not being important  that is the ecstasy   ultimately  it s what yeats says   such a sweetness flows into the breast that we laugh at everything and everything we look upon is blessed   that’s always there  it’s a benediction  a transference  it’s gratitude  really  the more of that a poet keeps  the more genuine his nature   he also notes   if one thinks a poem is coming on   you do make a retreat  a withdrawal into some kind of silence that cuts out everything around you  what you’re taking on is really not a renewal of your identity but actually a renewal of your anonymity  \\n\\n\\n \\nwalcott said his writing was influenced by the work of the american poets  robert lowell and elizabeth bishop  who were also friends \\n\\n\\n \\nhe published more than twenty plays  the majority of which have been produced by the trinidad theatre workshop and have also been widely staged elsewhere  many of them address  either directly or indirectly  the liminal status of the west indies in the post colonial period  through poetry he also explores the paradoxes and complexities of this legacy \\n\\n\\n \\nin his  essay  what the twilight says  an overture   discussing art and theatre in his native region  from dream on monkey mountain and other plays   walcott reflects on the west indies as colonized space   he discusses the problems for an artist of a region with little in the way of truly indigenous forms  and with little national or nationalist identity  he states   we are all strangers here    our bodies think in one language and move in another   the epistemological effects of colonization inform plays such as ti jean and his brothers  mi jean  one of the eponymous brothers  is shown to have much information  but to truly know nothing  every line mi jean recites is rote knowledge gained from the coloniser  he is unable to synthesize it or apply it to his life as a colonised person walcott notes of growing up in west indian culture \\n\\nwhat we were deprived of was also our privilege  there was a great joy in making a world that so far  up to then  had been undefined    my generation of west indian writers has felt such a powerful elation at having the privilege of writing about places and people for the first time and  simultaneously  having behind them the tradition of knowing how well it can be done—by a defoe  a dickens  a richardson \\nwalcott identified as  absolutely a caribbean writer   a pioneer  helping to make sense of the legacy of deep colonial damage  in such poems as  the castaway     and in the play pantomime     he uses the metaphors of shipwreck and crusoe to describe the culture and what is required of artists after colonialism and slavery  both the freedom and the challenge to begin again  salvage the best of other cultures and make something new  these images recur in later work as well  he writes   if we continue to sulk and say  look at what the slave owner did  and so forth  we will never mature  while we sit moping or writing morose poems and novels that glorify a non existent past  then time passes us by  \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nwalcott s epic book length poem omeros was published in  to critical acclaim  the poem very loosely echoes and references homer and some of his major characters from the iliad  some of the poem s major characters include the island fishermen achille and hector  the retired english officer major plunkett and his wife maud  the housemaid helen  the blind man seven seas  who symbolically represents homer   and the author himself although the main narrative of the poem takes place on the island of st  lucia  where walcott was born and raised  walcott also includes scenes from brookline  massachusetts  where walcott was living and teaching at the time of the poem s composition   and the character achille imagines a voyage from africa onto a slave ship that is headed for the americas  also  in book five of the poem  walcott narrates some of his travel experiences in a variety of cities around the world  including lisbon  london  dublin  rome  and toronto composed in a variation on terza rima  the work explores the themes that run throughout walcott s oeuvre  the beauty of the islands  the colonial burden  the fragmentation of caribbean identity  and the role of the poet in a post colonial world \\n\\n\\n \\nderek walcott was awarded the nobel prize for literature in   two years after publishing the epic poem  omeros   he was known for writing about  the harsh legacy of colonialism and the complexities of living and writing in two cultural worlds   his poetic voice reflected a blend of his ear for the english language and his sense of his own people stephen breslow explained that he and the swedish academy chose derek walcott for the nobel laureate in literature because his work had  a strong regional voice that transcends its topical locality  through the depth and breadth of its poetic resonance and through its global human implication   it was walcott s ability to be more than just  exotic  that brought his work critical attention  breslow explains that  walcott has merged a profound  rhapsodic reverie upon his remote birthplace – its people  its landscape  and its history – with the central  classical tradition of western civilization   this ability shows the importance of multiculturalism and literary mastery to the swedish academy  walcott s works represent how different cultures can enrich one another to produce even more compelling works in his nobel acceptance speech  walcott describes life on antilles and what it means to discover identity  he describes all of the  broken fragments  of his  diasporic  identity  people need books  he says  but they are not enough to encompass all that a culture is  walcott says that  the visible poetry of the antilles  then   is  survival  because  all of the antilles  every island  is an effort of memory  every mind  every racial biography culminating in amnesia and fog   he encompasses the diasporic identity found in caribbean literature by looking at how insignificant he feels because he cannot  alone  fully bring together a cultural identity \\n\\n\\n \\nwalcott s work has received praise from major poets including robert graves  who wrote that walcott  handles english with a closer understanding of its inner magic than most  if not any  of his contemporaries   and joseph brodsky  who praised walcott s work  writing   for almost forty years his throbbing and relentless lines kept arriving in the english language like tidal waves  coagulating into an archipelago of poems without which the map of modern literature would effectively match wallpaper  he gives us more than himself or  a world   he gives us a sense of infinity embodied in the language   walcott noted that he  brodsky  and the irish poet seamus heaney  who all taught in the united states  were a band of poets  outside the american experience  \\nthe poetry critic william logan critiqued walcott s work in a new york times book review of walcott s selected poems  while he praised walcott s writing in sea grapes and the arkansas testament  logan had mostly negative things to say about walcott s poetry  calling omeros  clumsy  and another life  pretentious   he concluded with  no living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished than walcott  though few individual poems seem destined to be remembered  most reviews of walcott s work are more positive  for instance  in the new yorker review of the poetry of derek walcott  adam kirsch had high praise for walcott s oeuvre  describing his style in the following manner \\n\\nby combining the grammar of vision with the freedom of metaphor  walcott produces a beautiful style that is also a philosophical style  people perceive the world on dual channels  walcott’s verse suggests  through the senses and through the mind  and each is constantly seeping into the other  the result is a state of perpetual magical thinking  a kind of alice in wonderland world where concepts have bodies and landscapes are always liable to get up and start talking \\nkirsch calls another life walcott s  first major peak  and analyzes the painterly qualities of walcott s imagery from his earliest work through to later books like tiepolo s hound  he also explores the post colonial politics in walcott s work  calling him  the postcolonial writer par excellence   kirsch calls the early poem  a far cry from africa  a turning point in walcott s development as a poet  like logan  kirsch is critical of omeros  which he believes walcott fails to successfully sustain over its entirety  although omeros is the volume of walcott s that usually receives the most critical praise  kirsch believes midsummer to be his best book his poetry  as spoken performance  appears briefly in the sampled sounds in the music album of the group dreadzone  their track entitled  captain dread  from the album second light incorporates the fourth verse of walcott s  poem  the schooner flight  \\nin  dutch filmmaker ida does released poetry is an island  a feature documentary film about

methodist community  who felt overshadowed by the dominant catholic culture of the island established during french colonial rule as a young man walcott trained as a painter  mentored by harold simmons  whose life as a professional artist provided an inspiring example for him   walcott greatly admired cézanne and giorgione and sought to learn from them  walcott s painting was later exhibited

hundred dollars   she was just a seamstress and a schoolteacher  and i remember her being very upset because she wanted to do it  somehow she got it—a lot of money for a woman to have found on her salary  she gave it to me  and i sent off to trinidad and had the book printed  when the books came back i would sell them to friends  i made the money back  the influential bajan poet frank collymore critically supported walcott s early work after getting his high school education from st  mary s college  he received a scholarship to study at the university college of the west indies in kingston

that year he also received a macarthur foundation fellowship in the united states   walcott taught literature and writing at boston university for more than two decades  publishing new books of poetry and plays on a regular basis  walcott retired from his position at boston university in   he became friends with other poets  including the russian expatriate joseph brodsky  who lived and worked in the u s  after being exiled in the   and the irishman seamus heaney  who also taught in boston his epic poem omeros     which loosely echoes and refers to characters from the iliad  has been critically praised  as walcott s major achievement   the book received praise from publications such as the washington post and the new york times book review  which chose omeros as one of its  best books of   walcott was awarded the nobel prize in literature in   the second caribbean writer to receive the honour after saint john perse  who was born in guadeloupe  received the award in   the

university of essex as a part of st lucia s independence day celebrations  in february   he became one of the first knights of the order of saint lucia      in  a harvard sophomore accused walcott of sexual harassment in september   she alleged that after she refused a sexual advance from him  she was given the only c in the class  in  a student at boston university sued walcott for sexual harassment and  offensive sexual physical contact   the two reached a settlement in   walcott was a leading candidate for the position of oxford professor of poetry  he withdrew his candidacy after reports of the accusations against him of sexual harassment from  and  when the media learned that pages from an american book on the topic were sent anonymously to a number of oxford academics  this aroused their interest in the university decisions ruth padel  also a leading candidate  was elected to the post  within days  the daily telegraph reported that she had alerted journalists to the harassment cases  under severe media and academic pressure  padel resigned  padel was the first woman to be elected to the oxford post  and some journalists attributed the criticism of her to misogyny and a gender war at oxford  they said that a male poet would not have been so criticized  as she had reported published information  not rumour numerous respected poets  including seamus heaney and al alvarez  published a letter of support for walcott in the times literary supplement  and criticized the press furore  other commentators suggested that both poets were casualties of the media interest in an internal university affair  because the story  had everything  from sex claims to allegations of character assassination   simon armitage and other poets expressed regret at padel s resignation          methodism and spirituality have played a significant role from the beginning in walcott s work  he commented   i have never separated the writing of poetry from prayer  i have grown up believing it is a vocation  a religious vocation   describing his writing process  he wrote   the body feels it is melting into what it has seen… the  i  not being important  that is the ecstasy   ultimately  it s what yeats says   such a sweetness flows into the breast that we laugh at everything and everything we look upon is blessed   that’s always there  it’s a benediction  a transference  it’s gratitude  really  the more of that a poet keeps  the more genuine his nature   he also notes   if one thinks a poem is coming on   you do make a retreat  a withdrawal into some kind of silence that cuts out everything around you  what you’re taking on is really not a renewal of your identity but actually a renewal of your anonymity       walcott said his writing was influenced by the work of the american poets  robert lowell and elizabeth bishop  who were also friends      he published more than twenty plays  the majority of which have been produced by the trinidad theatre workshop and have also been widely staged elsewhere  many of them address  either directly or indirectly  the liminal status of the west indies in the post colonial period  through poetry he also explores the paradoxes and complexities of this legacy      in his  essay  what the twilight says  an overture   discussing art and theatre in his native region  from dream on monkey mountain and other plays   walcott reflects on the west indies as colonized space   he discusses the problems for an artist of a region with little in the way of truly indigenous forms  and with little national or nationalist identity  he states   we are all strangers here    our bodies think in one language and move in another   the epistemological effects of colonization inform plays such as ti jean and his brothers  mi jean  one of the eponymous brothers  is shown to have much information  but to truly know nothing  every line mi jean recites is rote knowledge gained from the coloniser  he is unable to synthesize it or apply it to his life as a colonised person walcott notes of growing up in west indian culture   what we were deprived of was also our privilege  there was a great joy in making a world that so far  up to then  had been undefined    my generation of west indian writers has felt such a powerful elation at having the privilege of writing about places and people for the first time and  simultaneously  having behind them the tradition of knowing how well it can be done—by a defoe  a dickens  a richardson  walcott identified as  absolutely a caribbean writer   a pioneer  helping to make sense of the legacy of deep colonial damage  in such poems as  the castaway     and in the play pantomime     he uses the metaphors of shipwreck and crusoe to describe the culture and what is required of artists after colonialism and slavery  both the freedom and the challenge to begin again  salvage the best of other cultures and make something new  these images recur in later work as well  he writes   if we continue to sulk and say  look at what the slave owner did  and so forth  we will never mature  while we sit moping or writing morose poems and novels that glorify a non existent past  then time passes us by        walcott s epic book length poem omeros was published in  to critical acclaim  the poem very loosely echoes and references homer and some of his major characters from the iliad  some of the poem s major characters include the island fishermen achille and hector  the retired english officer major plunkett and his wife maud  the housemaid helen  the blind man seven seas  who symbolically represents homer   and the author himself although the main narrative of the poem takes place on the island of st  lucia  where walcott was born and raised  walcott also includes scenes from brookline  massachusetts  where walcott was living and teaching at the time of the poem s composition   and the character achille imagines a voyage from africa onto a slave ship that is headed for the americas  also  in book five of the poem  walcott narrates some of his travel experiences in a variety of cities around the world  including lisbon  london  dublin  rome  and toronto composed in a variation on terza rima  the work explores the themes that run throughout walcott s oeuvre  the beauty of the islands  the colonial burden  the fragmentation of caribbean identity  and the role of the poet in a post colonial world      derek walcott was awarded the nobel prize for literature in   two years after publishing the epic poem  omeros   he was known for writing about  the harsh legacy of colonialism and the complexities of living and writing in two cultural worlds   his poetic voice reflected a blend of his ear for the english language and his sense of his own people stephen breslow explained that he and the swedish academy chose derek walcott for the nobel laureate in literature because his work had  a strong regional voice that transcends its topical locality  through the depth and breadth of its poetic resonance and through its global human implication   it was walcott s ability to be more than just  exotic  that brought his work critical attention  breslow explains that  walcott has merged a profound  rhapsodic reverie upon his remote birthplace – its people  its landscape  and its history – with the central  classical tradition of western civilization   this ability shows the importance of multiculturalism and literary mastery to the swedish academy  walcott s works represent how different cultures can enrich one another to produce even more compelling works in his nobel acceptance speech  walcott describes life on antilles and what it means to discover identity  he describes all of the  broken fragments  of his  diasporic  identity  people need books  he says  but they are not enough to encompass all that a culture is  walcott says that  the visible poetry of the antilles  then   is  survival  because  all of the antilles  every island  is an effort of memory  every mind  every racial biography culminating in amnesia and fog   he encompasses the diasporic identity found in caribbean literature by looking at how insignificant he feels because he cannot  alone  fully bring together a cultural identity      walcott s work has received praise from major poets including robert graves  who wrote that walcott  handles english with a closer understanding of its inner magic than most  if not any  of his contemporaries   and joseph brodsky  who praised walcott s work  writing   for almost forty years his throbbing and relentless lines kept arriving in the english language like tidal waves  coagulating into an archipelago of poems without which the map of modern literature would effectively match wallpaper  he gives us more than himself or  a world   he gives us a sense of infinity embodied in the language   walcott noted that he  brodsky  and the irish poet seamus heaney  who all taught in the united states  were a band of poets  outside the american experience   the poetry critic william logan critiqued walcott s work in a new york times book review of walcott s selected poems  while he praised walcott s writing in sea grapes and the arkansas testament  logan had mostly negative things to say about walcott s poetry  calling omeros  clumsy  and another life  pretentious   he concluded with  no living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished than walcott  though few individual poems seem destined to be remembered  most reviews of walcott s work are more positive  for instance  in the new yorker review of the poetry of derek walcott  adam kirsch had high praise for walcott s oeuvre  describing his style in the following manner   by combining the grammar of vision with the freedom of metaphor  walcott produces a beautiful style that is also a philosophical style  people perceive the world on dual channels  walcott’s verse suggests  through the senses and through the mind  and each is constantly seeping into the other  the result is a state of perpetual magical thinking  a kind of alice in wonderland world where concepts have bodies and landscapes are always liable to get up and start talking  kirsch calls another life walcott s  first major peak  and analyzes the painterly qualities of walcott s imagery from his earliest work through to later books like tiepolo s hound  he also explores the post colonial politics in walcott s work  calling him  the postcolonial writer par excellence   kirsch calls the early poem  a far cry from africa  a turning point in walcott s development as a poet  like logan  kirsch is critical of omeros  which he believes walcott fails to successfully sustain over its entirety  although omeros is the volume of walcott s that usually receives the most critical praise  kirsch believes midsummer to be his best book his poetry  as spoken performance  appears briefly in the sampled sounds in the music album of the group dreadzone  their track entitled  captain dread  from the album second light incorporates the fourth verse of walcott s  poem  the schooner flight   in  dutch filmmaker ida does released poetry is an island  a feature documentary film about walcott s life and the ever present influence of his birthplace of st lucia      in  walcott married fay moston  a secretary  but the marriage ended in divorce in   they had a son  the st lucian painter peter walcott  walcott married a second time to margaret maillard in   who worked as an almoner in a hospital  and together they had two daughters  elizabeth walcott hackshaw and anna walcott hardy  before divorcing in   in   walcott married for a third time  to actress norline metivier  they divorced in   his companion until his death was sigrid nama  a former art gallery owner walcott was also known for his passion for travelling to countries around the world  he split his time between new york  boston  and st  lucia  and incorporated the influences of different areas into his pieces of work       walcott died at his home in cap estate  st  lucia  on  march   he was   he was given a state funeral on saturday
